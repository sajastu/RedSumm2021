test-4,"actually (as usual) this didn’t happen today but about a year ago when csgo gambling was still a big of a thing... so let’s go.i was casually gambling on a common csgo gambling site. i deposited some skins and they just wouldn’t show up in my inventory on that site... so i typed in the chat that there’s a problem with my deposit. a few minutes later a „moderator“ of that gambling site texted me that he would look into my issue... while looking into the issue the system of said site offered me a refund... so far so good usually a normal person would just accept the refund offer and go home... well that’s where the tifu part actually starts.the mod asked me to add him on skype so we could talk, i called him we talked (as much as i could express myself with my limited capabilities in english as i’m not a native english speaker), i told him that i already received my items back and that everything is fine now... then he told me that he had to exchange the items because they were compromised and gliched out (those were around $50-60 in value). for a moment i thought that this is quite weird and doesn’t sound legit at all but hey as the stupid a** that i am i thought ok let’s do it... we did the trade and after a few minutes he meant that there aren’t any items like mine in the inventory of the bots and that the only way i could recover my value of skins was to give him some of my other skins and he would change the odds of the homepage in a way that i would win a really valuable knife in the next game with a 100% certainty... sounds ridiculous right? right! but as naive as i was i agreed and went on with the trade...  he seemed to actually do something as we had a longer talk. the talk actually was quite nice... ok he made fun of my broken english.. anyways he seemed quite trustworthy... somehow... sometimes and the uncertainty in my voice (i was f*cking scared and pretty much knew that i would never see my stuff again) but hey my only option was to wait and see what happens... well any rational mind knows what happened and so it did... after about half an hour of talking one of his buddies joined the conversation and they both yelled: „scammed!!“ and they hung of... as i said this happened a year ago and i now have some new skins i really but still this shouldn’t have happened...beware of bastards and your own stupidity xd",dumb me gave all his valuable csgo skins to some random person on the internet after a system failure on a gambling site and lost all of them... $300 in the sink!,i got scammed out of $50-60 worth of skins on a csgo gambling site. i agreed to trade them for some skins and got yelled at by his buddies.,0.38709677419354843,0.06666666666666667,0.19354838709677422

test-131,"a full lab report for fluid dynamics lab was due today by noon, and i was made group leader for this lab before the week long break. the professor grades really strict, so i was hoping to use break to my advantage and do a thorough job. group leader compiles the report and writes an abstract, so everyone has to be done before they can start. i also had to get everyone to sign the cover sheet that says we didn't cheat. i figured since i always get started on my section the weekend before it is due, and since there was an entire extra week, that it would be basically done by monday.monday came around and the google drive had the introduction finished and nothing else. this means three people hadn't started yet. i assumed that they were finishing up using the various programs applicable to this lab, since that happened on a past lab, so i let them know where i was on campus, and three of them showed up to sign the cover page.tuesday i asked for an update, pretty much in a panic, since i couldn't do anything and this isn't an easy class. i got pretty busy with class and work, os i didn't get to check in with them until after 7pm. one section had been submitted. two people had not started. after frantically nagging them for three hours, one more section was done, although it was a pretty sad excuse for a college report. the last guy had the most math heavy section and claimed to be working on it. i fell asleep and got up at 5am to write the abstract, only to find that he had done nothing. he finally had some graphs at 6.i went to the computer center to work on the formatting and abstract while he was still working and he finally finished at 11. this was due at noon. i wrote a terrible abstract because most of his results were wrong. by 11:30 i had finished and i tried to print the 26 pages on the only colored printer in the building. but, as i am apparently an idiot i forgot that my laptop connection to this printer is weird. it prints the first page, a blank page, and a page that says nothing but "" print error"". i had to use a community desktop to print the rest of it.then i tried to staple it. no staples in the heavy duty stapler, or so i thought. i tries to open it and put more staples in it, then i broke it. the whole inside spring set up no longer works. i don't even know how i did that. so i went to the library and stapled it there, then hunted down the last woman to sign the cover. i handed it in to the ta barely on time, and i forgot to put the date on the report and number the pages. i am going to fail this report.",i assumed my lab group would work over spring break and barely handed in a really bad lab report. i'm going to fail this report and i broke the expensive stapler.,"i fucked up by not getting my group leader to do a lab report before it was due, and now i will fail it.",0.35714285714285715,0.037037037037037035,0.28571428571428575
test-244,"like most fuck ups, this one happened on monday. it's still affecting me though, so i don't know if that still counts as a today for ya. like the title says, i go to a catholic highschool. the school is pretty snazzy so 99% of everything is done on ipads with precautionary measures for anti-cheating. i'm not *actually* a full blown atheist, if anything i'm an agnostic theist or something. so, as a consequence of having catholic school, you have to take religion class. considering the fact that i've been in catholic school since 1st grade, this class is pretty much a walk in the park. so here's where the fuck up starts. we get a test on that mel gibson movie ""passion of christ"". most of the stuff on the test was fairly easy, and a lot of the question were opinion based (i.e what do you believe the agony in the garden represents?) and i was almost done by the end of the period. we reach the final question. it was a ridiculously long question asking a bunch of things and requesting for a 3 paragraph essay. something i was really not in the mood to do. since i'm sitting next to another non-christian friend, i write the following ridiculously immature sentence: ""i don't believe in any of this bullshit."" me and my friend get a couple giggles, and since this exam was on our tablets and due tomorrow, i kinda left it there without turning it in. the next morning i realize that i only have 3 minutes to submit the test (due at seven, was currently 6:57) and i decided ""*well, if i submit it without the essay it'll still only count as around 5 wrong, i can get afford a c*"". i turn it in, and i go along with my life and head to school. religion class comes. i walk in, and my teacher says ""pettankman, can i see you for a second?"" me and my religion teachers are on good terms, so i thought she was going to talk to me about service hours and such. she shows me the electronic copy of my test, and my heart drops. she was nice enough to let me make it up, but she will not look me in the eye anymore. i'm also sure i won't be receiving any favors from her anymore. every day for now on is a constant anxiety as i walk into religion class. the guilt is pretty much the worst punishment here. also kinda funny how this post is around 3 paragraphs.","was a dick to a very nice religious lady by mocking her religion, will not look at me anymore, and now live in constant anxiety for 1h30m every monday, tuesday, and thursday.","i wrote ""i don't believe in any of this bullshit"" on a religion test and my religion teacher found out.",0.1509433962264151,0.0,0.11320754716981132
test-330,"as i woke up this morning, i was feeling a little sore so i do what i always do when i want to refresh myself, i decided to run a bath. i ended up running the bath really fucking hot by accident but i figured it would just loosen my muscles even more, which it did. anyway, the bath was hot as fuck, i threw some epsom salts in there (which are great for relaxing muscles) and i decided to just acclimate myself to the heat. it was actually very pleasant once i got used to the heat.  after about half an hour in the bath, i was feeling very tired, but in a good way. beads of sweat were pouring down my face , and i figured it was time to get out. i pulled the plug of the bath and stood up, when i began to feel very dizzy. this had happened to me before, where i get very feint and black-out a little, normally its not too bad and i just try to stand still and brace myself, however this time i couldn't brace myself for what was about to come.i managed to catch a glimpse of my visage in the mirror, staring blankly back at myself as my vision slowly faded to black, like i was going through a tunnel.  next thing i remember, is regaining consciousness maybe 5 seconds after blacking out. when you black out, the only way i can describe it is as if you were going into a very deep dream like state, then being woken up instantly. memories and flashbacks of your life, sometimes in a very abstract form seem to play back to you for that very short time that you are unconscious, and when you wake up it's similar to having a feeling of remembering a dream very vaguely after you just wake up. not only that, but i also remember feeling very *heavy*. it''s hard to describe, but i ended up waking up back in my bath tub, with my neck bent in a weird way and i remember shards of something in my mouth, and soon i could taste the blood. i didn't want to admit it to myself, but the truth of what happened became abundantly clear after a few seconds of regaining consciousness. i gotta say, it's not fun waking up after blacking out with chips of tooth in your mouth and blood all over. i grabbed a towel and dried myself off as i was still all wet and naked, and went to look in the mirror. half my front tooth was gone. i instinctively went to the scene of the crime, the bathtub, to see if i could find any parts of my teeth. i managed to recover two reasonably sized shards, which i found out was important to do when you chip your tooth, as the dentist can then just bind the chip back to the tooth. at that point, i did the only thing i could think of doing; i called my mom. i'm 17 and can't drive so she was my only hope of making it to some sort of hospital, otherwise i'd have to call an ambulance which i *really* did not want to do. i called her three times and she wouldn't pick up, i looked back at myself in the mirror and that's when i just broke down. i guess the shock wore off or whatever, but i just felt really sad, mostly that my day was ruined. like i knew i was going to have to go to a dentist and doctor and it was going to be a huge fucking deal, i was just really really bummed out. i haven't cried like that in so long ;c thankfully, after like 3 minutes she called back, i told her what happened and she rushed home. we managed to find a dentist who told me chip wasn't that bad, fixed it up a bit so it doesn't hurt as much and in a couple weeks i'll have it built up again. i also went to the hospital and got told why i passed out (when you're a teenager, sometimes you can be prone to passing out) and they basically just threw some tylenol at me after waiting 3 hours for blood test results. i was really hoping i'd get some painkillers. anyway, i was right about my entire day being ruined, but i'm finally home and i'm just happy the situation isn't too bad. be careful in bathtubs guys ;)[oh also here are the pics of the tooth](http://imgur.com/a/xboih)","passed the fuck out, chipped my tooth, ruined my day.","i ran a bath, blacked out and chipped half my tooth, woke up with chips of tooth in my mouth and blood all over.",0.29411764705882354,0.0625,0.29411764705882354

test-594,"after seeing a r/nottheonion post about the baranstain bears, i inevitably wound up on r/glitch_in_the_matrix and remembered a personal anecdote that is almost appropriate for posting there, except that it didn't end in mystery.  this anecdote ended with me realizing i had fucked up.once upon a time, i had an ex-girlfriend with whom i'd sometimes become friends subsequent to our relationship.  and everyone knows that being friends means doing favors so i was tasked with helping her arrange pet-sitting (she had two cats) during a time that she was out of town.  it was simple, really.  all i had to do was drive to her apartment a couple highway exits away, go into her apartment, which was unlocked, and get her keys off the dining table.  another friend of hers would come to my house to pick up the keys and take it from there.personally, i try to avoid asking for and/or doing favors as a general rule, but i was not as skilled at setting/enforcing boundaries back in the early aughts.  and so there i found myself driving to her apartment mega-complex one winter evening to pick up her keys.  it was really no big deal.  i got out to her apartment, drove like a half a mile into the complex to find her unit, and walked up the stairs to her place.  i open her door and see her two cats on the floor and keys on the table.  i grab the keys, make sure the cats don't follow me outside, and i lock the door and head back home.when i get home, we text briefly to coordinate with her friend who was going to come pick up the keys, and that's when i learned that my expected current reality had fallen out of sync with my actual current reality.  i don't remember exactly how or what she asked, but i definitely remember assuring her that i had grabbed the keyring with her car and apartment keys on it--the only one there on the table.  the one with the rolling stones key chain.""i don't have a rolling stones keychain,"" she wrote.nor, it turns out, did she have a scion.  which was odd, because the keychain i had picked up off her dining table had a scion key on it.and so i found myself driving back up to north austin, to return these keys i had inadvertently stolen during the raid i had just unwittingly conducted.  annnnd as i pulled up, wearing a black cap and a black track suit, a police cruiser was parked out front and a policeman was standing outside, speaking with the tenant.i profusely apologized and explained that i been expecting an unlocked apartment with keys on the table and two cats who looked like his cats, and the tenant explained to me that he had been in the shower and came out to discover he had been burgled.  i was and remain grateful that i was neither arrested nor assassinated, neither by law enforcement nor by homeowner (renter).  it was an honest mistake.if i recall correctly, where i had gone specifically wrong was by going to a building number that was suffixed with a letter or not going to a building number with a letter suffix?  i forget.  the other friend was able to take over the whole task, and i went on to be a productive member of society. edit:  someone i told the story at the time suggested the gentleman whose keys i took had described himself as having been using the toilet at the time.  now i honestly can't remember if it was, [""i was taking a shit"" or ""i was taking a shower.""](http://www.themarysue.com/memory-distortion-in-brain/)","accidentally entered the wrong dwelling and took someone's stuff, returned it without incident.","i thought i had stolen my ex-girlfriend's apartment keys, but it turned out to be the only one on the table.  i had to drive back up to north austin to return them.",0.16326530612244897,0.0,0.08163265306122448

test-964,"surprisingly, my fuck up actually happened today.here's some backstory first:my father, mother, and younger sister all got macbook laptops a few years ago. i was the one that helped them set up their laptops and what not. i did the usual: sign them into icloud, import some old files, download chrome, etc. over the years i would sometimes use their laptops whenever mine was not in reach.**yesterday**8/31/14 = the fappeningi saw a post hit the front page about nudes being revealed. i curiously scrolled through the comments and saw this glorious subreddit, /r/thefappening. as soon as i entered the subreddit i was blown away by the number of pictures posted there. i was like a kid in a candy store. so many nudes from so many famous people! i recently started college and have my own apartment, so i didn't have to worry about my family seeing my browsing history or anything. the first thing i did was bookmark the popular post of that subreddit so that i would have a bunch of famous nudes easily accessible. then i began my journey.jennifer laurence nude? *bookmarked*.victoria justice nude? *bookmarked*.kate upton nude? *bookmarked*.ariane grande nude? *bookmarked*.more kate upton and jennifer laurence nude? *bookmarked*.  *bookmarked*.  *bookmarked*.after spending about 30 minutes in /r/thefappening, the entire top of my google chrome browser was packed with nsfw bookmarks. i was actually pretty proud of myself. having the freedom to bookmark anything i wanted without my parents finding out about them was the greatest feeling ever.**today**9/1/14 = the post-fappeningsince i had two days off due to labor day weekend, i decided to come home from college and pay my family a visit. i missed the first train home, but was able to take the next one and arrive just in time for dinner. it was odd. no one was talking at the table. my mother, my father, and my sister just looked down at their plates and ate quietly. it took about 10 minutes before my mom finally breaks the silence and asks me if i'm enjoying college. i told her how i'm enjoying the new apartment and how everything has been going well so far. i can tell by my mother's facial expressions that something is wrong, so i ask her what's up. she tells me that i should ""stop uploading nonsense"" on the internet and that i could be put in jail for what i did.i was so confused at what she was trying to get at, but then my sister brought down her laptop. as soon as she opened up chrome, my face turned bright red. it turns out that all of the bookmarks on my personal computer had synced to every computer because of chrome's sync feature. in other words, chrome had saved all of my nsfw celebrity bookmarks onto each of my family member's laptops. when my mom saw these bookmarks, she asked the rest of my family why these bookmarks were stored on her laptop. this led to some google searches concerning ""the fappening"". due to the abundance of celebrity nudes i had bookmarked, my mother actually thought that i was one of the ""hackers"" she read about that was responsible for uploading a massive celebrity nudes leak. i'm lying in bed right now trying to cool down after such an embarrassing dinner. i would like to remind everyone about the sync settings that are on chrome. *please. turn them. off.* --------------------------------------------------**edit:** there are a lot of questions concerning my fuck up, so i will try to answer most of them. before i begin, keep in mind that i originally had no idea about this cloud feature until yesterday. so people are calling me an idiot for signing into chrome with my own account instead of using my family's accounts. i do agree that i am an idiot, but the reason why i logged into my google account on their new computers was because i had a list of family files/photos uploaded to google drive. i would access my own google account, go to the files, and then download them onto their computers. after i was done with that, i would **sign out** from my google account. people keep saying that i never signed out. i did sign out, but i guess i never knew that i had to sign out from the sync feature on chrome. next, why the hell would someone bookmark nudes knowing they would get deleted? i actually didn't know they were all about to get deleted at the time. bookmarking them was the first thing that came to mind. and for the big one, why didn't i just save them rather than bookmark them? here i honestly don't have a straight answer, because i figured that bookmarking was no different than saving something onto your computer. like i said, i wasn't really thinking about the nudes being deleted at the time, so i didn't think bookmarking something was so weird. in fact, i feel like bookmarking stuff is much easier than downloading, but then again that's just me.i know i fucked up, and i'm aware of the irony here.","chrome synced all of my ""fappening"" bookmarks to my family's computers. mother thought i was responsible for leaking hundreds of celebrity nudes.",google chrome synced all of my nsfw celebrity bookmarked onto each of my family members laptops. my mom thought i was responsible for the fappening.,0.6666666666666666,0.3913043478260869,0.5416666666666667

test-1971,"note: this happened last month and i am posting now because i am no longer employed at this company, also using an alternate account because other co-workers know my main account and my crazy friend still works there. this will also be a very long post as i remember it vividly and will add all the details i can remember.   so for those of you that don't know, there is this drug called salvia which is still legal in many states within the us. when you smoke it the results can be unpredictable. some people lay down, roll around and moan - some walk around trying to talk - and some people, as you will soon learn, just totally freak the fuck out. the only way i can describe this drug is it's like having your consciousness ripped from your body and sent to an alternate reality where your worst nightmares and fears become reality. the worst part is that the moments after you smoke the salvia, you forget ever smoking it. so you have no idea what's happening to you. the trip only lasts 5-10 minutes but for the person who smoked it, it can feel like days.   to put dosage into perspective, the concentration i had is 20x, which is (theoretically) 20x stronger than the raw leaf. i smoked a very small pinch of this and ended up scaring the fuck out of myself.   on to the story.   so me and my buddy, who i will refer to as tyler, like to take smoke breaks together and just chat for 15 minutes (meaning that we are still wearing our work shirts with our work logo on them). we had talked about my salvia experience and he was interested in giving it a try himself some time. on this particular day, he asked me if he could give it a shot. here is how our conversation went.**me:** here? now?**tyler:** yeah, why not?**me:** this isn't a very good setting. we should go back to your place later on and do it inside where the environment is a little more controlled.**tyler:** come on man, it can't be that bad. i've done [insert long list of drugs] before so i'm sure i can handle this.**me:** fine. but just a small amount. this shit needs to be respected.   we walk around the side of the building to our cars, and he sits down in his passenger side seat with his legs out the side. i hand tyler the baggie and he proceeds to fill up his entire pipe with salvia. i try to tell him that that's way too much and that he should go easy on his first try, but he won't listen. i asked him for probably the 100th time if he was sure he wanted to do this and he just laughs. next, he puts the pipe to his lips and takes the entire bowl in one hit. it was at this moment that i knew i fucked up. **00:30** - he was fine at first. he began giggling, inspecting his hands, looking around. the usual. he then tried to stand up and immediately fell over onto the ground. i tried to help him back into the seat, but it was as if his legs had turned to jello and he wasn't able to stand up. he tried to talk but all that came out was drool and air. still, this is pretty standard. i just need to get him back into his chair and wait for him to ride the trip out. **02:00** - as i'm trying to get him into his chair, he suddenly stands up straight, grabs me by the arms, and looks right into my eyes. my god... his eyes... he had the look of someone who legitimately thought they were about to die. he then says calmly: ""i don't like this consciousness..."" he kept repeating himself over and over louder and louder until he was screaming. he probably said it 10 times. at this point, he's shaking and sporadically looking around. he then jumps up onto the open passenger door and sits on the top. i didn't want him to fall, so i calmly tried to usher him back down in the seat when he stops shaking, again looks me in the eyes, and whispers: ""i gotta get outa here""**03:00** - this is where shit hits the fan. he barrel rolls over the roof of his car (breaking off the side view mirror in the process) and takes off at a dead sprint towards the busy road. i don't know why, but i yelled his name a few times (with no response obviously) before calmly walking after him. he ran into some bushes, then made a left turn away from the road (thank god) and ran out to the middle of the parking lot in front of the store where he laid down stiff as a plank with his arms at his sides right in front of an old couple who had just parked their car. they tried asking him if he was alright, but i interjected from 25 feet away and calmly told them that he had a stomach ache and was just running it off (such a dumb cover, but they didn't ask questions). **05:00** - before i can catch up to him, he gets back up and begins sprinting around the back of the store where a small group of people are walking. as i get closer i hear them say:**people:** where is your friend?**tyler:** please help me...**people:** your friend is over there dude. go back to him.   tyler comes sprinting back down the side of the building. i grab him by the arms and try to calm him down but he just looks at me with a horrified face and says ""i don't know if god is real"", then takes off running again. **06:00** - as i round the corner of the store, i see him lying back down on the asphalt directly in front of the store windows. at this point, he begins to babble so i ask him if he's ok. he responds, incoherently, but it's a response nonetheless. i get him up, put his arm around me, and take him back to the car. **7:00** - i sit him down and ask him some questions:**me:** what is your name?**tyler:** tyler.**me:** what is my name?**tyler:** awelldressedchicken**me:** good. where are we?**tyler looks around,** ""i have no fucking clue.""**me:** that's fine. relax bro. you smoked some salvia and you're just coming out of the trip. you're safe now. i got you.**tyler:** what is salvia?   he took off his shirt, and i could see he was shiny with sweat and still shaking a lot. i offered him some water which he gratefully drank and then burned his fingers with a cigarette to help him ""return to reality"". he asked me if i could hear carnival music too. there was a jazz concert going on across the street and i could faintly hear the music, but no carnival music...   after forcing himself to puke his guts out and recollecting his head. we went back into work as if nothing had ever happened. nobody confronted us about it, so i suppose we got very lucky with none of the folks he ran into making any comments. he later told me what was going on from his perspective during the trip, but that story would take a whole nother page or two just to document.",co-worker smoked a lot of a very strong deliriant for the first time. ran around the parking lot yelling and laying down in random places. doesn't know if god exists. we didn't get caught.,"smsmoked salvia, thought he was going to die.**",0.0,0.0,0.0

test-1752,"this whole mess just got cleared up about 5 minutes ago (though i highly doubt anyone has let it go).  about a week ago, we had a problem with the pipes that were connected to our toilets. everytime you flushed any toilet in the house, the pipes, which led to the basement, would leak and pretty much spill onto the carpet. as a result, we had to call a plumber to fix the pipes. turns out, the pipes are not the only problem, but also the toilets. apparently they weren't flushing properly or weren't installed right so the pipes were bound to leak. so my parents decide to invest in new toilets, but the plumber can't install them until the week after because he is a hardworking plumber with lots of clients lined up who need their plumbing fixed.  a week later, he takes out the toilets. we have 2 toilets: first one is in the guest bathroom on the main floor and the second is on the second floor. he takes the one on the main floor out first and it's super easy, he does it in a snap. when he goes to take out the other one, he says there's something wrong. apparently, the previous house owners got lazy when they retiled the bathroom floor, and instead of taking out the first set of tiles, they just tiled over it and around the previous toilet. the new toilets that my parents bought did not fit properly because of the second layer of tiles, so the plumber spent an hour trying to take the tiles out, but he had to leave because, again, he had other clients.  at this point, we have no toilet on the second floor and can only use the main floor bathroom. i have to say that these toilets are primo and i don't know what kind of toilets they are but they are excellent and never seem to get dirty, they're taller, shinier, fits my ass nicely, so i'm loving these toilets and i always get excited to use it.  the plumber comes back the next day and finally installs the toilet on the second floor, but he had to put sealant on the toilet, so we couldn't use it until the sealant was dry, to my dismay. my mother is quite extra, so once the sealant dried overnight, she put more sealant for good measure. again, we couldn't use the toilet until the sealant was dry. this time, the sealant didn't dry overnight (because my mom used some cheap ass sealant).  when i came home from work today, everyone had gone to bed already, because it was late. i sat down to eat and drank some wine (you know, friday night). not too much that i'm so drunk, but just enough to fall asleep.  i jerked awake at round 4:30 am in the morning because i needed to pee. i went to the bathroom on the main floor and started to pee. throughout my peeing, i'm admiring the feel of the toilet on my ass, just thinking, goodness, what a fucking nice toilet. halfway through my pee, i realize that i could probably use the toilet upstairs because it's been two whole days and the sealant should be dry. so i stop my pee - which is a horrible idea - because i really want to try out the new toilet upstairs. granted, it's the same toilet, but it was a new environment and i wanted my ass to christen this brand new toilet because i was certain my ass would be the first ass on this toilet.  i'm struggling to hold in my pee and i'm trying to walk up the stairs with my thighs clenched shut because my bladder needs to continue to dispel my urine, but i won't let it until i reach that toilet. i finally reach the top of the stairs only to see the bathroom door closed with a sign that says ""still can't use, sorry"". my eyes go wide in panic, adrenaline pumps through my veins, and i try to run back down to the other bathroom. in reality, my limbs just decided to do their own thing and my body twisted and i fell down a couple of steps, which in turn, lead my bladder to burst and i unceremoniously pissed all over the staircase, which also happens to be carpeted.  my parents and my sister run out of their rooms to find me sprawled all over the staircase in pain, crying, maybe a little drunk, and soaking in my own piss. i had to explain to them why it happened, which got me a belly laugh from my dad, an angry ""you pissed all over my carpet"" from my mom and a ""the next time we have a family event to go to, this is the story i'm going to tell"" from my sister.  i am currently disposing of the last pee - soaked paper towel i used to clean up the stairs. it'll probably smell worse in the morning, but i'm tired and i had a long day from work, so i'll deal with it after some sleep.",had a plumbing problem and had to change the toilets. i was so obsessed with the way my ass felt on these new toilets that i tried to stop my pee half way to use the other toilet upstairs. turns out that toilet could not yet be used so i ended up pissing all over the stairs.,"i peed on my parents' new toilet because i wanted to christen it, fell down the stairs and burst my bladder.",0.282051282051282,0.05263157894736841,0.20512820512820512

test-2942,"mixed feelings about this to be honest. i want to say i'm not worried about it, but i'm also rather disheartened that some people might view me in a different light. the story goes like this:yesterday we had a school band rehearsal. we're taking part in a school music event, and we're including some of the younger years of whom are in our 'house' (this is important later on). a friend and i have been discussing this event for a **long** time, since we won the competition last year, with sweet child o' mine. this year we settled on [walk this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_uyypb-gk) by aerosmith. we have someone in our year who could do the beatboxing for the run dmc side of it, and we were planning on having all the stage theatrics, mimicking the video, which we thought would give us a few more points from the judges. the idea was pretty much set in stone, and so the first rehearsal night came [yesterday].. i had a twilight lesson (an after school lesson) of chemistry. i managed to get into the school's music department at roughly 16:30, so we still had an hour left. i was told that we weren't allowed to do walk this way because the lyrics were too *rude*. this sort of annoyed me, because this sent everything that we had previously discussed flying, and we now didn't have any idea of what we were doing. people were arguing and shouting out different songs, or shouting shit like ""that song is terrible! no way!"" this got me swearing, a lot. ""fuck this"", ""fuck that"", ""cunting shit"". . . you probably get the idea. i must have said *cunt* about 3 times, no more than that. i also pissed someone off by not letting them take the main vocal role, as we had set that aside for someone else this year, so that fucked them off and then they accused me of bullying.so, i get into school today and everything's fine. the other sixth formers and myself finally decide a [song that we're going to play for house music this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbm6gxllbiw). all's well.until i get back from biology..two of the other sixth formers in my year spoke to the music teacher, and apparently she was a bit annoyed by the fact that i had sworn in front of the young years in the school, when i (a sixth former) should have actually been setting an example.. i also found out that the girl who i pissed off had accused me of bullying, and that the head of sixth wanted to talk to me. it was safe to say that i was shitting myself, because i was worried that i may have been kicked out of sixth form, and that meant that i wouldn't be allowed to take my a levels or go to university or any of that. my entire future was on the line here.i went into the head of sixth's office, and he asked me what happened. i laid it straight to him and told him what happened. i figured that i may as well be honest and not try to wriggle out of it, which i hope he saw and appreciated the honesty.. he started the conversation with *""you've made a very big mistake""*, which instantly sunk my heart, as i figured it would follow with a *'and we're not allowing you to be a part of our school anymore'*. thankfully this wasn't the case, and i was *let off*. i was told to apologise to the music teacher (which i'm going to do on monday, because i couldn't find her after school today), and that i made the year 7s feel *intimidated*. i, personally, think that's bullshit, but i'm hoping to sort that out, at least. i've apologised to one of them for the swear-fest. as for the girl who accused me of bullying, i explained it to the head of sixth that i clearly wasn't bullying her, but i can understand that perhaps she might not have felt like i was being her best friend. all in all, i've been told that i'm not allowed to take part within the house music competition this year, but a teacher is putting a good word in for me, and i plan on apologising to anyone i should apologise to. if i'm not in the band, that means that we won't be allowed to do the song that we want to do, because that means that there wouldn't be a skilled enough guitarist to learn the song. my only *main* concern now is that i didn't apologise to the music teacher, and i said that i would, even though i couldn't find her.","swore a lot and pissed someone off, so i was kicked out of a music competition.","i swore in front of a bunch of sixth formers, and was accused of bullying.",0.38709677419354843,0.0689655172413793,0.3225806451612903

test-3160,"this happened about a year ago, and boy did i fuck up. sorry i'm not a great writer but it's an absolutely true story.so i've been using tinder for a long time, i'm actually really open about using it and i've met a lot of really awesome people through it. i'm not socially awkward and i have no problem meeting women outside of the online dating, i guess it's just another avenue. i like to think i'm a good person but unfortunately, tinder has ensured me my spot in hell for eternity. one day, i matched this girl on tinder, she was really cute, really funny and we immediately clicked. i live in the jersey shore and she lived in nyc. we didn't meet immediately because a pain in the ass to get to the city, especially for a tinder date, but i'm a comedian and i often get booked in clubs down there, so we figured we'd meet after a show one day.after a few months of talking and facetimeing we were both getting pretty anxious to hang out, we figured even if we didn't click romantically in person we got along well enough to have a good time together. one day i had a autism awareness benefit show in hoboken, nj. i went down to the show alone and absolutely killed it. i was feeling good about the whole thing and i sent my tinderella a text bragging. as luck would have it she was planning on going bar hopping for her friends birthday. she told me that i'm a few blocks away from a train that will take me to exactly where she was and she thought it would might be a good idea for me to meet her!i was a little tired, and not really looking so hot so i let her know it might not be the best night, she wasn't going out for quite a few hours so i decided to stay and have a few drinks and try to wake up a little, i thought maybe a little liquid confidence might give me the boost i need to meet her that night. as soon as i hung up the phone, it happened, the most beautiful girl i've ever seen in my life walks in the bar with her clearly gay best friend. as soon as they walk in, the two guys sitting next to me pay their tab and leave, this girl sat right next to me. we meet eyes, and it was like a god damn movie. we start talking and she's fucking amazing you guys. we literally fall in love within an hour. we hang out for a few hours and it just keeps getting better. but then i felt my phone vibrating, it's tinderella, at this point my mind is made up, i need to stay with this girl i just met, it was something different. she could clearly hear i was still at the bar and commented that i must have caught a second wind. i laughed and agreed, she told me to come down and hang with her friends. my phone died right at this moment, i couldn't even respond. i find an outlet and after about 10 minutes i call her back to give her the bad news.but before i could even say anything she blurts out ""well it might be kind of weird to bring you around my friends before i meet you so i would really like to get a drink alone with you somewhere.""...""but james i need to tell you something..."" and this point i absolutely know i'm not going to meet her tonight but curiosity got the best of me so before i could tell her it wasn't happening i ask her what she needs to tell me.and then she said it.

(it had arms that like connected to its hip so there was a little gap in between its body and the arm).       it was there for a couple days before my equally stupid friend said i should make a leash and put it though the arm so i could tie it to my backpack or something so more people could laugh at my joke. sure, i though, that would be funny!    so we went to class and he started helping me make a leash with tape. i tied the tape between his little arm loop and we started stretching the tape out. just then my history teacher asks what we're doing so my friend pulls the tape and it snaps and somehow managed to wrap around the whole penguin.    (this is where obama being black comes into play) my teacher walks over and looks at me sitting there with an animal in my hand with obamas face on it  with tape wrapped around it. more specifically the tape looked like it was wrapped around its neck. you know, like i was hanging obama! he starts to ask what i was doing but stops, rips little obama from my hands and calls the principle.    so cut to me in the principles office with this noosed obama sitting between us. i explained that i was just trying to make a rope to carry him with but that my friend messed it up and that i was not trying tape around its head. he picked it up and pulled the tape straight to find out that it was indeed tied to his arm and not his neck. he still was not very happy though.    he'd said something about how if that it would have gotten out that a kid at my christian school was hanging a black person in my locker or something that the school would have been in some deep deep trouble (with a media frenzy and what not) but he said he understood i was just trying to be funny and that the teacher over reacted when he took the obama from me without explaining myself.    luckily he only had me serve a detention for disrupting class and stuff. he was also my track and cross country coach so that probably helped a lot too. so yeah, i hope you guys enjoyed my fu that almost got me expelled that i'd forgot even happened to me.",put obamas face on a penguin to be funny. accidentally made it look like i was hanging him and almost got in a lot of trouble.,i taped obama's face to a happy feet penguin in my locker and almost got expelled for it.,0.4888888888888889,0.09302325581395349,0.3111111111111111

""hey guys, who wants a dried ghost chili?"" he said. i'll never forget that sentence.      at first, i said no. who do they think i am, to do some dumb shit like that? then, after some relentless pestering, i took a pepper, but still didn't have the courage to eat it. after a few more minutes of my friends badgering me, i ate half the pepper and stuck the rest in my pocket. i chewed on it for 10 or so seconds because my mouth just wouldn't produce any saliva for me to swallow it with, with good reason, because this was nothing to salivate to. a few seconds after i swallowed it, the spice in my mouth kicked in. and it was bad. after that, the pain in my throat kicked in, twice as hard. i was in intense pain. it was only 7:24 am and i didn't know how long the effects would last.  fffffffuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkkk.      fast forward to 8:10 am. the effects had not even begun to dissipate. i then turned to my good friend sam and told him that i still had the other half of the pepper. he then said to me ""you won't eat the other half."" i then reached into my pocket and said ""you're trying to control me."" and i ate the other half. it was a grave mistake. want me to teach you all some pepper math? here it is: 1/2 + 1/2 = somewhere over 9,000. it was very, very bad at this point. i managed to become composed enough to ask the teacher to go to the bathroom, and i ended up staying composed like this until i got in the bathroom. and then i didn't even start crying, but tears leaked from my eyes like niagara falls. my tongue was swelling up, my eyes were watering, my nose was running, and i felt like i was gonna throw up. i ended up drinking a shit ton of water and then going back to class, trying not to focus on it and to just do my work. it didn't work. and from this point on, it was like a russian history lesson. things got worse.      want to know how unlucky i am? we had a guest speaker today. i had to sit in the theater room for 3 hours after eating a dried ghost chili on an empty stomach. by the way, when you eat one on an empty stomach, you feel like it is inflating to the point of going going hindenburg on your ass. my stomach was feeling terrible, and i felt like i was gonna throw up. here's a science lesson on peppers: capsicum (the spicy stuff in peppers) doesn't digest. so throwing up would be like reliving it in reverse. luckily, i ended up not. now, i could keep going with the story, but it would just be me telling you how much my stomach hurt. i'll try and update after i shit, if i'm feeling up to it (or if i know how to, this is my first post).     the spice in my mouth is 100% gone, as is the pain in my stomach, (i had a granola and protein bar to fill me up) but as i said, the shit has yet to come.","spicy shit came in through the mouth, and is going to be supa hot fire coming out.",i ate a dried ghost chili on an empty stomach and had to sit in the theater room for 3 hours.,0.21052631578947367,0.0,0.10526315789473684

test-3807,"i need to get this out of my system, tonight's been extremely heavy, i don't think i would be writing if it weren't for luck... (tl;dr down below)**day 1 salvaging - smooth.**so, i have a motorized scooter, and it's been progressively turning bad recently. knowing what was the problem i bought the tool required and waited to order a new part for the engine, i wasn't in a hurry to spend that much money. but yesterday during work i stumbled upon the exact same model of scooter that i have, only abandoned and completely stripped. so without hesitation i asked a colleague to come with me the same night, the neighborhood isn't even that bad, but i suppose if you stumble upon bad people who wants to fuck with you, they'll come swarming real quick. so we went there, quickly recovered the part, a neighbor was watching from his balcony, i asked if the vehicle was here for a long time, she said yes and that i really wasn't robbing anybody at this point, everything went smoothly, i even installed the part on my vehicle not ten minutes after. my scooter was in the best shape ever, extremely responsive and fast.i was satisfied, and i wanted more, my brakes weren't in par with the speed anymore.**day 2 salvaging - the chase**so i decided to return tonight, i headed there with all the tools, parked at a distance, got prepared, started unscrewing, people passing by, no problem. but then, a young dude from the projects passed by, tracksuit, trainers, and aiming to blend in and justify my business, i asked him if he lived here and if the vehicle was here since long, i should've shut the fuck up. dude immediately understood i was an outsider salvaging, he claimed the wreck was his friend's, i understood i would be fucked real quick, i got my tool in my backpack, started walking out, he followed me, called some people, then two others joined, i almost went for a deserted park but quickly turned back thinking this would be the end of me, i quickly ran towards busy roads as they were yelling ""stop him"". i passed about 4-6 dudes trying to get my sorry ass in a narrow street. i ran like hell, they were coming with determination, i had a glimpse at a gigantic black dude behind me, they all would've broken me in half. arriving at a roundabout i tried to stop cars so they would pick me up, first was full with kids, dead no, the second was in the same case, the third was a single young woman, i begged and she opened the door, i got in and she stepped on it to catch a green light. i thought i was out of the shitstorm, she was laughing a bit at the situation, i couldn't think straight, i was just in shock and i wasn't even checking behind me nor giving her instructions to turn somewhere, we were on a straight road. i was waiting for the stress to settle down, without knowing i was waiting for the shitstorm to hit me a second time...**collateral damages and the escape**without me even noticing it, the pursuers were right behind us in a white car, they all got out and i started hearing voices and hitting sounds on the cars, i began to see what was happening, one tried to open the driver's door where that innocent girl was, another took some trashes from a trash container (wtf?) and threw it at my opened window, she quickly drove, but not fast enough, that trash guy broke a passenger window and when i turned my head forward i notice the windshield was partly broken aswell, everything went extremely fast, i asked her to go fast while i checked behind, they were pinned back, i asked her to turn after we took some distance, she rightfully switched her mood to being very mad at me telling me that the car wasn't even hers, i told her to stop and she told me to fuck off out of the car. i was in a weird state of being concerned for my safety, being sorry for the collateral shit, and still very very focused on my life and how i would survive this. the street was deserted so i stopped for a sec in a private garden to hide just in case, stayed a tiny bit.from this point, i had two goals, recover my left behind vehicle that was well outside the pursuers perimeter, and also not stumble upon them whilst trying to get there, i know the neighborhood by heart so finding the safest route wasn't a big deal, but i was getting extremely paranoid, ""hide from every car"" paranoid. running when crossing the boulevard, walking near parked cars so i could hide quickly, at some point i even left my backpack below a car to lose the weight. i couldn't allow them to find me, although it was very likely that they were back at the starting point, or hiding in the same area, we have a heavy cop presence in my city, when shit goes down beside witnesses you can start to count, cops will be there within minutes (i even heard sirens when recovering my vehicle, i'm sure the pursuers are linked). so i made my way there à la mgs, hiding from absolutely every vehicle, i quickly got to my scooter, put my helmet in a hurry, and fucking took off as if there was a tsunami behind me, evading the main streets. **what now...**again i sometime work in that neighborhood, so my options are to never wear my tonight's outfit, nor the noticeable holster that holds my money. i could keep a very light beard for some months, and always keep my helmet's sunshade in that neighborhood, i could ask colleagues to go work there in my place when available. thankfully there are no connections between my vehicle and me. now for the young woman and her car, she could either claim that i am guilty, or that the pursuers are. can't tell if she would go to the police or directly manage this with her insurance. i just want to stay alive, i don't mind paying a fine, i don't know if the salvaging is truly illegal and if i'd get identified by bystanders. ______","needed parts to repair my scooter, found wreck scooter in bad neighborhood, successfully

pursuers were still on my ass, they broke two windows of that stranger's car, we got away, i took off alone. went mgs near the said neighborhood trying to recover my left behind vehicle. successfully.

test-3181,"so this fu happened a looong time ago, i was about 6-7 yrs old in the 2nd grade at the time. i'm 24 now. i'm also male. to this day it's still engrained in my mind..so at my elementary school we had a huge rectangular field in the back of the school with a dirt track around it. i mean this field was really big, it spanned the entire width of the entire school grounds. it had to be at least 1.5-2 football fields in size. on the field all the sports activities would take place; you could have a couple soccer games, a baseball game, and a giant game of tag going on at once. this is also where we would have pe.anyways, it was pe and for my pe class they would combine two classes into one just because they could, so there were quite a few students. at the end of every pe class, the teacher would have some fun closing activity. like a race to the other side fence and back, from sideline to sideline. the teacher would also mix the race up sometimes too, like one class vs the other, girls vs boys etc., or it would just be the entire pe class racing. so it's the end of pe class and the teacher is doing the closing race. i'm sitting on a little curb that lined part of one side of the field, talking to two of my guy friends and not paying attention to what the teacher is saying. in the corner of my eye i start to see the closing race has started, and people are starting to run across the field. i think to myself some 2nd grade version of, ""oh shit! the race started!!! shit shit shit!"" i turn to my friends and say verbatim in the coolest way possible, ""sorry guys, i gotta run."" and i get up and start sprinting as fast as i could. why i didn't realize my other two guy friends weren't in the race to begin with, or why they didn't get up with me to run is something that never occurred to me.by the time i started running, the other students were already maybe a 1/4 way to the middle of the field. by the time i caught up with everybody else, we were about at midfield. this is when i realized something was wrong. this is when i realized i had fu'ed. this is when i realized that the teacher had called just a girls race. some of the faces on the girls that i had caught up to had that wtf/laughing face on. i came to a dead stop and just froze as i watched all the girls of the two classes combined continue running across the field, running further and further away from me. after what seemed like forever, i snapped out of my frozen shock, turned around, bowed my head and started the walk back to all the other guys now sitting there laughing at me as i made my way back.and that is how, at such a ripe, young, innocent age, i experienced my first, most embarrassing, most memorable walk of shame. *i might have exaggerated the size of the field, but to a 2nd grade me, that's how big it was. in all honesty, if i went back there today i'd probably still think it's a big field.",i ran and experienced my first walk of shame,"i ran across a field that i thought was a football field, but was actually a girls race.",0.14814814814814814,0.07999999999999999,0.14814814814814814

(it's actually a bit more complex than that, but this will suffice.) the day we broke up i had this party, organised by my boss and everyone at work was invited. i went to that party and had a great time. during that party i got to know my female colleague (which i was quite interested in before) a little better. let's call her ""jess"" the party was great and after one drink came another and so on. when the party was over we decided to have an afterparty with a small group of people who wanted to party on (including jess). we took the bus to another house and continued our party there. during the whole day and night (the party started at 1pm on sunday, because thats when all of our colleagues have no shift.) jess and i got some chemistry going. when it was time to sleep jess and i got to sleep together on the couch. we were quite tired, but we still got to kiss and stuff.  this is where i fucked up. my (former) so and i really love(d) eachother and decided back then that we should stay best friends since our relationship went so well other than the arguments we had. we had this plan for a while to go on a vacation to paris together. even though things had happened with jess as i thought my so and i broke up. my (former) so found out little by little what had happened at my party with my colleagues and blames me for cheating. apparently she didn't really mean to officially break up bladibladibla. we eventually got in a big big fight together. at some point i decided to walk out of our hotel for a while to smoke some. i totally forgot my cigarettes in outlr room so i decided to get some booze instead. i drank the bottle empty asap and walked around in paris for a while. i also finally found a store to buy cigarettes so i could smoke some. my so kept calling me over and over again but i never answered. she eventually started texting me, so i just replied that i'm fine and i would be back later tonight. (keep in mind that, by now, i'm drunk as fuck) i finally decide to go back to our room. when i enter the room i find her totally wasted from the jack daniels i brought with me. i found out that she found jess on facebook and had sent her angry messages. jess read it and started calling me and texting me being angry as fuck as she thought i was single.now i'm lying here with an over the top drunk so and jess spamming my inbox, being trapped in fucking paris and i have 4 more days to go!. by now my so has been trying to vomit for a long time now, but it's not helping. i better help her now.

test-3879,"i'd been having some gut issues over christmas and was finding myself with an awful combination of indigestion and constipation, the result of which had been putrid shits accompanied with rotten gas. anyway, having spent christmas with the in-laws i'd managed to escape using their awfully placed bathroom over christmas and held it until we got home on boxing day. i guess i should tell you about the awfully placed bathroom. anyone reading this who has been to meet a partner's parents will know how big a deal the first and any bathroom visits are. this bathroom is located on the ground floor of a bungalow with an attic renovation. it's situated right across from the living room with a frosted glass door. if that wasn't bad enough the actual toilet sits against a wall with a frosted window above it and has the galley style kitchen extension on the other side. you can pretty much hear everything from both the living room and the kitchen when you're in there which means they can hear you. anyway, i've been going to the house for 10 years and only use the bathroom for poops if i am desperate. so as my mother is away for the new year and we would usually spend new years day with her. we get an invite for dinner to my so's folks instead. i say i don't want to go and that i'd rather just make something at home and relax but she wants to go and see her folks and do a little wedding planning while we are there. (side note: we are getting married this year) we go for the meal and have honey glazed ham, roast potatoes, carrots and peas with a splash of gravy and lemon cheesecake for dessert. i get to drinking whisky with my soon to be father in law and listen to the new rolling stones album with him, a christmas gift on vinyl from the so and i. as we have both had too much to drink and can't drive home we decide to spend the night rather than get a taxi home. my stomach had been ok all day and i was relieved and thought the issue had finally passed. we went upstairs and climbed into bed and i fell asleep with no issues at all. i awoke sometime later to a vengeful stomach making sounds straight from hell. it was gurgling, cramping, sloshing and most of all i was farting and they were unholy. my girlfriend who'd drunk entirely too much champagne was comatose next to me and had no knowledge of my current discomfort. i slipped out of bed and crept down the creaky stairs and through the kitchen to the horribly placed bathroom. even though nobody was up i was still considering holding it, but my stomach had other ideas. i sat down and immediately it started, i imagined it was like tar due to the heat down there, i sit for what feels like an hour with shit just pouring out of me. i decided to make a tactical flush but know i was in no way finished. i go again and it's the same, piping hot turd flowing from my anus like molten rock. i sat for a while after i've finished and i felt quite emotional i was shaking and sweating and i'll admit it. i shed a tear. once the dust had settled and i gathered myself i wiped and flushed and the moment i stood up the ungodly stench hit me. the only comparison i can make is that it smelt like a slaughterhouse on the hottest day of the year. i actually wretched while i washed my hands. but here was the moment. do i shut in this creature from my bowels or leave the door open and allow it to distribute around the house. i left the door open thinking the thick smell would thin out and disperse through the night. i climbed back into bed and fell asleep next to my drunken and snoozing wife to be. part 2: fallouti awake in the morning feeling ravenous and my stomach was making much healthier sounds and simply wanted feeding. my fiancee was already up so i got dressed and went downstairs. i opened the door and was taken back by a wave of stink, my stink. the back door was wide open ushering in the cold fresh air and it still reeked. my so stood in the kitchen and simply said ""we think the drains have backed up"". i walked to the bathroom and the smell had engulfed the whole house. my soon to be father in law was stood next to the toilet surveying the damage. i asked if i could help in anyway, he said no and that a plumber was on the way. i went back to the kitchen and asked if my so was ready to go as we would just be in the way. she said no and that she wanted to stay and help her mum and sister. they were just stood there, there was nothing they could do but open windows. some 10 minutes later the plumber arrived and surveyed the area and determined there was no sewage back up and everything was fine. then he dropped the a bomb "" did anyone go to the toilet last night?"". i shook my head but my so's little sister said she had. the plumber laughed and said ""well this is on you then"" he finished his cup of tea, handed over his bill (double the price due to the bank holiday) and left. my soon to be sister in law was mortified and actually started to cry because of the embarrassment of it all. i stood in the corner nursing a coffee and kept my mouth shut. on the drive home my fiancee said she had woken up in the night and i wasn't there. i said i got up for a whiz at one point so that could have been it. she knows it was me but like me she is happy for her sister to take the fall. i doubt we'll ever discuss this again.",took a crap at my in laws that smelt like sewage and caused them to call an emergency plumber and let my soon to be sister in law take the fall.,i had to use the bathroom at my so's house and left the door open. the toilet overflowed and my father in law had to come out to rescue me.,0.3225806451612903,0.06666666666666667,0.22580645161290322

test-4183,first the accident was not an emergency. i walk out of my apartment this morning heading to work to find a car having conveniently parked on the second step of the entryway to my apartment complex. it was a white honda with a special paint job and parts were lying along the steps around the car. i pull out my phone to take a picture and was going to call the police about it when i see something moving in the car and realize the window is fogged up. not only did i see a drunken car accident this morning but someone hooking up in said car. it was super early and i did not have time to deal with some drunk person getting mad as i was taking a picture of their frivolous activities so i bolted. i never did call the cops...,i tried to take a picture of a drunken car accident to realize two people are hooking up in the front seat...,i saw a car accident and someone hooking up in said car.,0.4117647058823529,0.18749999999999997,0.4117647058823529
test-4212,"this happened in january. i went to a religious jewish high school in manhattan, and i graduated this year. this is a pretty small school, only about 400 students in total. i'm a pretty quiet kid and very often i just keep to myself. some backstory, last year (junior year) i, along with about 50 other students across all grades, cheated by stealing tests from the school server. i wasn't exactly the ""mastermind"" of the operation, but i suppose i was pretty involved. basically i and one other kid got caught. the school couldn't expel me (it got pretty complicated), but i was semi-ostracized during senior year. i attended class normally but that was about it. i didn't get to go on school trips, and i couldn't be in school during non-class hours. anyway for one class i did a report about the mafia. the report was my end of term project and i was giving it the friday before final exams. the cover slide of the report was a thompson submachine gun, which is largely associated with 20th century mobsters. anyway, i gave the report and closed my laptop. later on during english class i opened my laptop to take notes. being my usual adhd idiot self i saw the picture of the gun and my mind started racing. i started googling various guns in the middle of class until i landed on the ar-15. the teacher happened to walk to the back of the class and see the screen. she simply told me to close it, and that was that. when i got home my mother started yelling at me. she explained that the principal called her. he said he got a report from my english teacher that i was looking at weapons online, and ""given my history,"" they were afraid i might ""do something bad."" he told my mother that he was very concerned about me and that my parents should have a conversation with me in order to make sure i was ""stable."" he informed her that he would be leaving his phone on all saturday just in case something should happen with me. for those of you who don't know, that is a big deal because as a religious jew observing the sabbath he never leaves his phone on on saturday. i explained my side of the story to my parents. my father laughed and my mother wanted to kill me. they informed the principal that everything was all right and that it was just a simple misunderstanding. he said ok and that was that. until sunday night when he called and said that i wouldn't be allowed in school to take my exams until i meet with a psychiatrist and get cleared to return to school. after meeting with a psychiatrist and assuring him that i would not shoot up my school we told the school about the meeting. after missing the first day of tests, i came on the second day just to be thrown out of the building by a security guard in a very non-discrete manner. he stated that upon the administration's orders i was not to be allowed to set foot inside the building. my parents managed to contact the school to let me in. their condition for admitting me into the school was that i continue to see a therapist until the end of the year. after that day the school had people watching me as long as i was in the building. (they also made my life as difficult as possible for the next 6 months but that's a different story.)","teacher saw a gun on my laptop, school thought i was going sandy hook on them.",i did a report about the mafia and the school thought i was a terrorist.,0.3225806451612903,0.20689655172413796,0.3225806451612903
test-4201,"so today (well, last night actually) i was driving home from work and decided i wanted to drink a little. i'm 22 and still going through my ""drink whenever because i can"" phase. so i stop at this corner store not too far from my house because they're always open and they have cheap beer. i pull up to the store and notice a homeless guy sitting outside next to a redbox. i don't think much of it. i get out of the car and start walking to the store and this guy flies off the ground and into my face faster than you can say ""unprovoked hostility"" and starts yelling at me like, ""what motherfucker, you wanna go? i've had a fucked up day"". i was literally dumbfounded and not knowing how to respond, i just walk around him and continue towards the store. he goes and sits back down by the redbox. i try and open the door and it's locked and i see thhave cashier on the phone, he looks semi panicked. gives me the ""one minute"" motion with his hand. instinctively, i look over to the homeless guy who's been staring at me the whole time and gets up once i look over saying something like, ""that's it motherfucker"" and starts storming over to me. i turn away from him and he puts his fists up, ready to fight me. i just ignore him and then he punches me in the shoulder. lolwut. i start walking away and he kicks me in the butt... hard. i just get back in my car, completely freaked out as to what just happened, and drive to my friend's house down the street. we laugh about it for a few minutes and go back to the store, after i call the police cause ya know... i don't want someone else getting their butt kicked by this guy.we get back and the police are there. also, i'm really stoned at this point and also i had just lost my wallet a few days ago so i have no id/driver's license. the cashier points me out and the police question me. the whole time i'm just praying they don't ask for my id for some reason. turns out this guy has been terrorizing the area for a while. i get my beer and go home.edit: i left out the part where i talked to the cashier and he told me the guy had been in there waving a knife around trying to get the cashier to go outside and box him. i'm glad i didn't get aggressive... cause i would've been stabbed.",i got my butt kicked by a homeless guy.,ii almost got stabbed by a homeless guy.,0.5882352941176471,0.39999999999999997,0.5882352941176471
