test-41,"obligatory   this actually did happen today. my family and i live in the sun blasted hellscape that is central arizona, usa.  the whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city  it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  for those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  it's one of the full household sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day. for various reasons not apropos to this tifu, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  today i decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  possibly inspired by another recent tifu, i also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  while cleaning, though, i noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""no big deal,"" thought i.  eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  i scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit. here's where the tifu really starts.  some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible   they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  i decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places i couldn't reach.  ""but,"" thought i, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  i figured i should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, i figured, is better at that than bleach? right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""uh, dude."" yeah, i know.  or, i should have known.  but i didn't think it through, so i poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  almost immediately thereafter, i took a whiff and started coughing.  at that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution  with a weak acid  creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic   like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and i'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system. i immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  so now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days i'll be coughing like i've got the black lung, pa.   edit   words edit 2   front page, neat.  it has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine   i think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that i'm an engineer, i have to   if everyone doesn't know, i'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  can't have that. edit 3   lot's of fake internet points and my first gold!?  it's almost worth the war crime!  thanks!","tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.","tried to kill bacteria in my humidifier with bleach, ended up creating chlorine and chloramine gasses. i'm pretty sure i'm going to die.",0.30769230769230765,0.16216216216216217,0.25641025641025644
test-80,"so i live in area where hurricane irma is predicted  to hit and, like any reasonable person, i'm trying to not get my shit fucked over by winds.  most of the windows on my house have shutters already to protect against these things but in my backyard there are 4 huge glass walls that are bordered by cement.  me and my family are drilling large sheets of wood to protect them so they don't break during up the hurricane.  it turns out, while trying to drill into the cement to nail the boards, that the glass extends past the cement. learned that the hard way.  i heard a loud pop! while drilling. then, suddenly, i see the shatter creep its way up the entire wall. i've been hearing popping sounds coming from it and i expect it to colapse any second now.  we've now boarded that glass wall completely, and we fear we if we try drilling again the vibration will cause it to collapse completely.  not sure what to do :/ picture:","tried drilling planks to protect my windows from hurricane irma, ended up shattering and now i'm fucked","tried to drill into a cement wall to protect my house from hurricane irma, shattered the cement wall and now i'm afraid it's going to collapse.",0.5652173913043479,0.3181818181818182,0.5652173913043479

test-729,"here is the story of how i was mauled by my cat after a series of freak events that were ultimately my fault. this happened about a year ago and i still have scars . my wife and i have a 10 year old cat who we adopted from the humane society when he was roughly 6 months old. he is a generally a great cat and we love him dearly. our cat is normally very well behaved when indoors and hardly causes any trouble. unfortunately when go goes outside and smells other animals  he essentially turns feral again. he will hiss and attack us and is just not friendly. he is not declawed so this can be quite the experience. the second he gets indoors from such a state he turns friendly again. we do notlet him outside intentionally because of this. the night of the mauling i was watching my son and my wife was at a bachelorette party. she doesn't have as many friends as she used to due to kids  and rarely makes it out to social events so her going to this bachelorette party was basically the highlight of her social year. i made the mistake of letting the cat get into the garage. when the cat is in the garage he will sometimes go into feral mode and sometimes not. i decided to try to get him back inside now since he didn't seem mad. after a bit of trying i succeeded.  i quickly realized my mistake when the cat appeared to be slightly angry. to calm him, i opened a can of wet cat food and let him eat. when he was finished he swiped around the paper plate to ""bury"" his food as cats will do. unfortunately we had let the cat's claws get a little bit too long and one of his claws got stuck in in the rug. not wanting the cat to get agitated, i go in to quickly unhook him. i succeeded after a little while and freed the cat only to find that he was, indeed, very agitated and was starting to growl. i knew that i had to get the fuck out of there so i picked up my other cat  so he wouldn't get attacked and walked upstairs. the  mean cat followed me upstairs into the one of the bedrooms. i didn't want to get stuck in the room alone and get in a situation where the mean cat would hurt the fat cat so i decided to bite the bullet and i dropped the fat cat and picked up the growling mean cat and threw him out of the room into the hallway and closed the door. the second i grabbed the mean cat he attacked and sunk his teeth deep   into my hand. blood was instantly literally squirting out of my palm. i did manage to safely shut the door. my son was in his room with his door closed so i yelled to him through the door/hallway telling him to keep the door closed and not open it at all no matter what. yelling further infuriated the cat and he sat outside of the bedroom i was in and attacked at the door and growled like mad. now i found myself trapped in the room with  blood squirting out of my hand and no way out. our basement is a walk out so i was 3 floors up and this was night so i couldn't realistically  jump out of the window without seriously hurting myself. i was losing what seemed like a lot blood that i called my wife and told her that she needed to come home immediately to save me. i was also worried that my son would go outside of his room and get attacked. the bachelorette party was in the middle of doing a wine and painting thing. it took quite some convincing  but she so told her friends that i had been mauled by a cat  who had trapped me in a room and left without finishing her painting. it was a 45 minute drive home but she arrived and was able to subdue the cat who had had some time to calm down. we found our other son sleeping with his clothes on in his bed with the door shut. i stained the carpet pretty badly with blood. we still have the cat since i think it was ultimately a freak occurrence that led this to occur but i am more wary of him now.   edit: i forgot to mention that the cat was on steroids to treat a temporary illness which probably contributed to the aggressiveness.",my cat went into feral mode and attacked me / trapped me in a room and my wife had to leave the social highlight of her year to come save me.,i let my cat out of the garage and he got angry and attacked me. i tried to rescue him and ended up mauling my other cat.,0.3508771929824561,0.10909090909090909,0.2456140350877193

test-701,"first off, this fu didn’t happen today, but about five years ago.    the day started off with my whole family: my little sister, father and mother going to a nearby ranch to ride a horse around the woods. i thought nothing at all could go wrong as i put on a pair of sandals, it’s not like they could fall off or anything, they’re strapped perfectly tight and it's a hot day so they're perfect.   so we get to the ranch and i get on a horse first. i ride for about ten minutes, come back to where i started and give my sister a turn. as she was only four at the time, my father had to hold a rope to keep the horse steady for my sister. as we were walking around the same trail i had just ridden a few minutes ago, my father got a phone call. this was where the fu started. as my father began to talk on the phone, he stopped paying very much attention to where he was taking the horse. as i was walking alongside the horse, making sure that my sister is safe, i was not paying attention to where the rope was going. somehow, i ended up between the horse and my father, with the rope behind me. as the terrain went a little downhill, the horse and my father sped up slightly. the horse who was being pulled back by the rope around my back and trying to go forward at the same time, sidestepped and landed a hoof right on my open toes. i don’t know if you guys have ever dropped something heavy on your toes, but if you did, this was exactly the same feeling, except the horse was a lot more heavy and his hoof was sharp too. in the moment, i had no idea what happened, then i feel sharp, crushing pain in my toe and look down to see the horse with his hoof pressing my foot into the dirt. i don’t know what to do so i try to take my foot out from under him, bad idea, very bad idea. as i do so, his hoof, still on my foot, slide my toenail off my toe, along with a chunk of flesh. so now i’m missing a large part of my toe, and the bones in my toe are crushed.    the first thing we do is get a bunch of ice and put it in a bag around my injured foot. then we get to the nearest drug store, which was about six miles away, and buy two small bottles of isopropyl alcohol. as the liquid is being poured onto my foot, it is freezing and extremely painful at the same time. my foot is shaking from the cold temperature of the alcohol, but is also in terrible pain from the wound. we then take a bunch of bandages and wrap it up as i doesn’t want to stop bleeding. after we get home, my mother cooks up some warm orange liquid and makes me keep my foot in it for about a half hour. the bleeding and pain stop and i’m able to see the damage that has been done without there being blood in the way. i can see a small part of my bone from where the flesh was torn and the nail clearly isn't there.   we get to the nearest hospital and they say that no cast or anything can really be put on. so they bandage up my foot and give me one of those shoes that kind of look like sandals, but are really heavy and loud to walk with. after about a month my bones were a lot better, and the wound is healing up nicely.    now, after five years, there is almost no sign that anything like that has even happened.","wore sandals to ride a horse, got stepped on, crushed foot, destroyed toe, had to wear a sandal like cast for a month.","went on a horse ride with my family, ended up missing a large part of my toe and crushing bones in my toe with the horse’s hoof.",0.27450980392156865,0.04081632653061224,0.1568627450980392

test-1410,"okay, this one is a little more recent than the last tifu that i submitted. this one's about a month old. so. let's get started. i was planning a trip up north to the city of allahabad to get some long pending personal stuff out of the way: namely, to visit the university and collect my degree certificates. for a degree that i had finished way back in 2003. lazy, yeah? okay, so in planning for this trip i have been looking through multiple airlines and a search site  so well, on to the story. the airport code for allahabad is ixd. and the airport also goes by the name of bamrauli.  i stopped the first planning session for some reason and picked up on it a week later.  one week later i decide to carry on with the planning and the booking of the tickets. this time, the catalyst was that my aunt had passed away and i was planning on paying my respects during the 13^th day ceremonial rites. so the trip would take me to allahabad first, and then to delhi. i get down to the booking search and start the process. remember that store of trivia? that kicks in. and being a lazy sob myself, i run a search using airport codes. quicker right? and the part where me brain misfiles things? well, it got the code back as ixb instead of ixd. the search engine promptly listed the destination as bagdogra, but again the defective wiring kicked in and mixed up bamrauli for bagdogra. i book the tickets. mmt also gives me a coupon for a hotel booking that i promptly use to book a hotel in allahabad. relax. the flight leaves early in the morning at about 0700 ish. the night before, some vague instinct prompts me to check the route from the airport to the hotel. i plug the details into good old google maps. thankfully, my lazy streak is still in place and i put in ixb instead of allahabad airport. google comes back with a 600+km ride. what in the name of hades unholy underpants? frantic scrabbling and it is confirmed. yours truly has booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is. crap . some more google fu resulted. air india is the only airline flying into ixb. the tickets are out there in nose bleed territory. luckily google comes up with a hit on rome2rio which helpfully points out that vns  airport is closer  and well connected by rail. some relief. cancel the two tickets that were booked  and book a new ticket to vns. leaving at 0830. home free? apparently not. i land in vns about an hour late. grab a taxi to the railway station. the taxi driver helpfully informs me that there is a festival that started a couple of days ago. lasts a month. massively increased travelling volume. oops. i get to the station and grab a journey ticket  and get to the platform. the next train is just pulling into the station.  now my brain is also running severely low on caffiene. i barge into the very first coach that i see . packed like a match box. once the train starts, i remember by second fu. i could have hopped into any of the second class reserved seating coaches, and found a empty seat. when the ticket examiner comes along, pay the difference and get an 'excess fare' ticket issue and you get to keep that seat for your journey. this is a tactic i have often used, but completely forgotten. i spend the next four hours  standing only in one position, no personal space bubble of any sort, sweating like a pig, half a foot from the door, six people between me and the open door, trying not to shove anyone out accidentally. and unable to even move me feet. i pop out at allahabad like a cork out of a bottle and spend the next fifteen minutes gently flexing my limbs to make sure all parts are in place. and wearily limp my way to the hotel. atleast the food was awesome  definitely the worst trip i ever planned. till date. 2/10.   edit: town names, minor spelling.","booked a ticket to the wrong airport, travelled for four hours in a bursting train under a self applied body bind curse.",booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is. i'm a lazy ass who booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is. i'm a lazy ass who booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is. i'm a lazy ass who booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is. i'm a lazy ass who booked tickets to delhi via bagdogra which is 600 km away from where my university is,0.09523809523809523,0.016129032258064516,0.09523809523809523
test-2411,"obligatory ""didn't actually happen today."" this occurred back in the mid 90's. i was a freshman in high school. book smart, not street smart. not at all street smart, as you'll soon see. being tall, i was on the basketball team, and being slow, i rode the bench. but this event didn't happen on the court, it happened after practice, in the bowels of our gymnasium. now, to get a sense of how this all went down, i need to first explain the layout of the locker/shower area   it's boring expository information but it all factors in. our locker room's shower was just a large rectangular room with about fifteen shower heads poking out intermittently along the sides. that shower room was flanked by two separate locker rooms that shared its use, but the three rooms were joined only by a tiled hallway. this hallway was empty but for about a dozen hooks on each end that we hung our towels on. so to shower, you'd leave the locker room, hang your towel on the hook, walk about eight to ten feet, turn left into the shower room, and pick a spot to wash yourself. on the walls of the shower room were liquid soap dispensers, but on that fateful day, only two of them were functional. it so happened that these two functional dispensers were the two on either side of the exit. the two biggest assholes on our team set up shop on both sides of the exit and proceeded to throw soap at anyone  that had finished their shower and was trying to leave. the called it a soap war, but they were the only one waging it so it was really just soap terrorism. seriously, freshmen suck. anyway, being book smart but not street smart, i saw this as a challenge, a game to be won. years spent taking showers in a large open locker room had trained me to be mindful of where i was looking. i feigned nonchalance. as teammates drifted out and then back in to wash off their soap shots, i laid back in wait. one of the soapers had eventually tired of the game, and i saw a potential window for escape. i waited until the other one randomly grabbed a bit of soap and threw it at another kid that was still showering. because why the fuck not, i guess. that was when i made my move. with a quick flick of my wrist i shut off the shower   this probably cost me some time but i'm no water wasting monster   and accelerated across the shower room toward the exit. in my head, time proceeds in slow motion as   while in full sprint   i glanced at that asshole teammate to see him wildly reaching for the soap dispenser for a hasty refill. i took the corner at full throttle and my focus turned to the rack of towels. gangly teenage arms flailing, i briefly scanned the hooks for my towel, only to see that it had fallen to the floor. i sure as hell wasn't going to stop and bend over to pick it up   i might as well have painted a bullseye around my butthole   so my only choice was to grab it without stopping. as i bent over and grabbed my towel off the floor, i noticed out of the corner of my eye what i would have noticed much earlier had the attentions of my add mind not been so divided: one of my teammates, facing away from me, standing bare ass naked in the doorway to the locker room. i put on the brakes, but i hadn't anticipated the effect that the slipperiness of the tile floor combined with my velocity, teenage lack of coordination, and awkward angle would all have on my balance and stopping power. i tried to stop. physics said no. what happened instead was that i slipped and went to the ground on my ass. but instead of laying there in pain like one might expect, i hydroplaned across the wet tiled ground and slide tackled that teammate from behind. he came crashing straight down on me, and etched permanently into my memory is the awful image of his bare ass dive bombing my face and slamming my head into the floor. i laid there in pain for a moment, the chirping birds and stars in cartoons having taken the irl form of teammates in shock yelling ""what the fuck was that?"" before erupting in laughter. the soap war forgotten, i apologized to the guy for getting myself rikishi bombed, and moved to towel off. my head ached, my ass hurt, and i'd sprained my pride. but at least i didn't get soaped.",my attempt to avoid getting blasted with soap resulted in me accidentally slide tackling a naked teammate and taking a bare ass to the face.,i was a freshman on the basketball team and took a shower in the bowels of the gym. two of my teammates were throwing soap at each other in a soap war. i saw a potential window for escape and shut off the shower.,0.2318840579710145,0.0,0.17391304347826086

test-2436,"this whole mess just got cleared up about 5 minutes ago .   about a week ago, we had a problem with the pipes that were connected to our toilets. everytime you flushed any toilet in the house, the pipes, which led to the basement, would leak and pretty much spill onto the carpet. as a result, we had to call a plumber to fix the pipes. turns out, the pipes are not the only problem, but also the toilets. apparently they weren't flushing properly or weren't installed right so the pipes were bound to leak. so my parents decide to invest in new toilets, but the plumber can't install them until the week after because he is a hardworking plumber with lots of clients lined up who need their plumbing fixed.   a week later, he takes out the toilets. we have 2 toilets: first one is in the guest bathroom on the main floor and the second is on the second floor. he takes the one on the main floor out first and it's super easy, he does it in a snap. when he goes to take out the other one, he says there's something wrong. apparently, the previous house owners got lazy when they retiled the bathroom floor, and instead of taking out the first set of tiles, they just tiled over it and around the previous toilet. the new toilets that my parents bought did not fit properly because of the second layer of tiles, so the plumber spent an hour trying to take the tiles out, but he had to leave because, again, he had other clients.   at this point, we have no toilet on the second floor and can only use the main floor bathroom. i have to say that these toilets are primo and i don't know what kind of toilets they are but they are excellent and never seem to get dirty, they're taller, shinier, fits my ass nicely, so i'm loving these toilets and i always get excited to use it.   the plumber comes back the next day and finally installs the toilet on the second floor, but he had to put sealant on the toilet, so we couldn't use it until the sealant was dry, to my dismay. my mother is quite extra, so once the sealant dried overnight, she put more sealant for good measure. again, we couldn't use the toilet until the sealant was dry. this time, the sealant didn't dry overnight .   when i came home from work today, everyone had gone to bed already, because it was late. i sat down to eat and drank some wine . not too much that i'm so drunk, but just enough to fall asleep.   i jerked awake at round 4:30 am in the morning because i needed to pee. i went to the bathroom on the main floor and started to pee. throughout my peeing, i'm admiring the feel of the toilet on my ass, just thinking, goodness, what a fucking nice toilet. halfway through my pee, i realize that i could probably use the toilet upstairs because it's been two whole days and the sealant should be dry. so i stop my pee   which is a horrible idea   because i really want to try out the new toilet upstairs. granted, it's the same toilet, but it was a new environment and i wanted my ass to christen this brand new toilet because i was certain my ass would be the first ass on this toilet.   i'm struggling to hold in my pee and i'm trying to walk up the stairs with my thighs clenched shut because my bladder needs to continue to dispel my urine, but i won't let it until i reach that toilet. i finally reach the top of the stairs only to see the bathroom door closed with a sign that says ""still can't use, sorry"". my eyes go wide in panic, adrenaline pumps through my veins, and i try to run back down to the other bathroom. in reality, my limbs just decided to do their own thing and my body twisted and i fell down a couple of steps, which in turn, lead my bladder to burst and i unceremoniously pissed all over the staircase, which also happens to be carpeted.   my parents and my sister run out of their rooms to find me sprawled all over the staircase in pain, crying, maybe a little drunk, and soaking in my own piss. i had to explain to them why it happened, which got me a belly laugh from my dad, an angry ""you pissed all over my carpet"" from my mom and a ""the next time we have a family event to go to, this is the story i'm going to tell"" from my sister.   i am currently disposing of the last pee   soaked paper towel i used to clean up the stairs. it'll probably smell worse in the morning, but i'm tired and i had a long day from work, so i'll deal with it after some sleep.",had a plumbing problem and had to change the toilets. i was so obsessed with the way my ass felt on these new toilets that i tried to stop my pee half way to use the other toilet upstairs. turns out that toilet could not yet be used so i ended up pissing all over the stairs.,"new toilets didn't fit properly, plumber had to put sealant on the toilet, we couldn't use it until the sealant was dry, and now we have no toilet on the second floor.",0.28571428571428564,0.06741573033707865,0.1758241758241758

test-3016,"this happened in the last 24 hours, so… technically today, right? earlier this week, my family got together to attend my grandpa’s funeral, which was held in my dad’s hometown. it's roughly a five hour drive over remote country highways. now, i’ve had my license for years, but i don’t have a car of my own. also, i hadn’t driven in a couple months due to attending my freshman year at college in another state. i wanted to keep my skills sharp, though, so i volunteered to drive. i’m a very conservative driver, and usually nervous about driving. but i want to drive, and know that if i don’t force myself to do it, i won’t get any better  and the anticipation is much worse than actually being behind the wheel. the trip went well, though. so did the funeral, where i at least got to visit with extended family despite the sad circumstances. we had taken two cars, and for the homecoming journey, i drove my dad’s suv, just me and him in the car. the return trip is where i fucked up. not on the highway, though. oh no. nor did i fuck up on the interstate leading into town. when we pulled into the driveway, i was—i admit—proud of myself for driving such a long distance for the first time. before this point, i had been too anxious to consider ever doing some sort of magical cross country road trip. now i was starting to think i could really do it someday in the future! stopping just short of our garage, i let my dad out of the car and he went inside. t minus fuckup in 3… 2… 1… i began to roll gracefully into the garage. as i pressed the brake, however, the car didn’t stop. it sped up. the following elapsed in under 5 seconds: i see the wall of the garage approaching. time slows down. my brain, faced with this unfathomable paradox, says **“press harder.”** after all, my foot is definitely on the brake, right?!? i give it another pump and the car begins to go even faster. suddenly a light bulb clicks, and i realize i’m on the gas. this revelation has blown my mind to the extent that i literally do not know where to move my foot in order to access the brake. and i’m surrounded by walls. of course, the suv crashes  into the side of a wooden staircase in our garage, as it happens. i panic and back up, hoping that the damage was just cosmetic, like maybe the bumper has a big dent now. nope. i guess a part of the staircase sort of got hooked underneath the right fender, and when i backed up, the fender was ripped pretty much halfway off. the bumper is also banged up. the repairs will cost $500. surprisingly, the wooden staircase is fine. this was my first accident. i apologized profusely to my dad, and the family is deciding what to do next. probably it’s going to be a rental car for a week, as the suv is not safe to drive in its current state. i now realize that just because i’m in our driveway doesn’t mean i can let my guard down. mostly i just feel terrible for giving my dad even more crap to deal with right now, and am currently trying to help any way i can, maybe drive him to the dealership in my mom's car  if he even lets me get behind the wheel .","was nervous about driving my dad’s car 5 hours on the highway back from my grandpa’s funeral. did great on the highway, then crashed in the garage after we got home because i confused the gas pedal with the brake pedal. result: one dented bumper, one peeled off fender, $500 repair cost, and my dad has to deal with my idiocy days after burying his father.",i drove my dad’s car for the first time and ended up crashing it into the side of a staircase because i didn’t know how to use the brake.,0.2626262626262626,0.10309278350515463,0.22222222222222224

test-3022,"this did actually happen today, but requires some preface. firstly, i am possibly the most awkward human on the planet. i was homeschooled up until high school and as a result even in my 20s my social skills fucking suck. i work in a restaurant as a supervisor for the kitchen, so often i'm the last one out and i lock up. some nights however, the assistant gm is there and when we are done, i will walk her to her car  and we make small talk about the day or vent frustrations or whatever.        fast forward to last night. fourth of july weekend has been insane. we have both been working long shifts and are tired as hell. we do our normal thing, i close the kitchen she does the front of house until we are done and we lock up and set the alarm and stuff. as we walk toward her car, i notice she is being unusually quiet and i ask if she is alright and she starts sobbing. so i give her a hug and calm her down and she tells me what is up . we talk about that for a bit and then when she is a bit better off we say goodnight and i tell her i'll see her tomorrow because i still owe her chocolate covered gummi bears, flowers, and i have to step on a lego. .   finally we arrive at this morning. i wake up and im still groggy considering i have basically slept 5 hours a night for the past week, but i recall the previous night and i figure that i should go through with bringing her the stuff to help cheer her up. so i get the flowers, gummi bears, and a kiddy lego set and go toward our workplace so i can catch her before she goes to work. i text her to ask her to meet me by her car and i mention the flowers and her response is "" you should not have done that"". it is at this time my sleep deprived brain wakes up and realizes i'm holding candy and flowers to give to a woman who was in a bad place the previous night and was vulnerable with me. now comprehending that this looks like i'm making a romantic gesture, i text her again to attempt to reassure her that i'm merely trying to be friendly, and these exchanges just add to the awkward. she did end up coming by and accepting the stuff which resulted in another awkward exchange where i again tried to reassure her that i was not suggesting anything romantic, i was really just trying to be nice  and make up for the previous fuck up, which i'm not sure she believed. after i left i texted again to feel out exactly how fucked i am by making a joke of the situation and saying that i should stick to handcrafted wood and leather items as cheering up gifts because there is no misinterpreting wallets and patio furniture.       as of 4 hours later she has not replied to this message, so i'm going to assume i'm fairly fucked. i'm just hoping i don't lose my job over this because as it is i'm only just in a place where i can live fairly comfortably without having to worry excessively about money. so going back to a minimum wage position would basically mean i need to move to a smaller place or go back to working 2 jobs. on top of this, i lost the lego i pulled out of the kit to step on so now i can't even finish the fighter plane.   edit: thanks for the advice y'all. i already planned on attempting to pretend this didn't happen. still no response to the joking bit so maybe she is doing the same. i won't find out until saturday. but fortunately the terrible feeling of wrong is going away slowly. edit 2: still no response, i am definitely gonna give it space and time and just kind of see what happens. also added paragraphs for easier reading. also, i definitely did not think of wood and leather's bdsm context, especially considering fifty shades' popularity.  edit 3: found the lego piece under the seat of my car! i can now finish the fighter plane and make at least one thing come out of this situation. i doubt there will be a response to my message, likely we will just get back to business as usual which is good. i went to work today and im not fired, so win there probably.  tomorrow will be the true test of how awkward this will be going forward. also i added spaces for the paragraphs instead of indents. mla habits die hard. edit 4: all good reddit! she is too preoccupied with the other dude situation to even care about what i did. had a totally normal workday, and the feeling of wrong is beginning to fade into isolated feelings of cringe.","brought my sad boss flowers and candy without realizing the romantic implication. made an awkward fool of myself trying to explain, and am now concerned about my job.","tried to be nice and make up for the previous fuck, ended up making it look like i was trying to be romantic and make her feel better.",0.21428571428571427,0.037037037037037035,0.17857142857142858

test-3114,"obligatory this happened six years ago. on a throw away because one of the parties involved is also a redditor. if it matters i've been redditing ever since this event happened. so one day my fuck buddy was doing work in my mothers yard. moms yard was super over ran with every type of weed you can imagine. and that included poison oak. my fuck buddy is a guy i've known my entire life. so he was pretty sweet with my son. my son was two at the time. my son was out back with us and came running up to me with a few handfuls of poison oak. my fuck buddy is horribly horribly horribly allergic to it. he kind of freaks out about it. and i figure if my kid is going to have the rash, i will probably get it some how too. so i take it from him. as it turns out, my son and i are not allergic to it. my fb goes and washes the ever living shit out of himself in the shower. i put my son down for a nap. i sneak in the bathroom to hop on the good foot and do the bad thing. he makes it very clear, that even though i have washed my hands not to touch him. so i don't, but i touch myself. that night i start to get itchy around my clit. i honestly didn't think any thing of it. i can't remember what i thought it was. my sons father came to visit from half way across the county the next day. we have a good day. i had broken up with the man maybe five months prior to this. so after my son goes to bed his dad and i are sitting on my bed drinking and watching a movie. we both get way too drunk. and he tries to fuck me. i was half awake, but it felt sooooo good on my itchy clit. i didn't care. until i realized what was going on and told him to stop. which he did. he went and slept in his car after that and i went to bed. some where in this time frame my fb tells me he has the smallest amount of poison oak rash on his dick. so i knew why i was itchy. even if you aren't allergic to it, you can't rub the oil on your pink parts. my sons father leaves. and i start getting phone calls. very angry phone calls about how i gave him an std. he had some rash. he had ""drippy dick"" and he hurt. and the man was furious with me. absolutely furious. and starts calling me drunk all the time furious. the more angry he became, the more worried i was that i had some thing too. i started looking up numbers for cheap clinics because i was too ashamed to go to the doctor. i was mortified. i finally convince him to go to the doctor. and i realize that his drippy dick and his pain is probably a kindey infection or a bladder infection. with some poison oak. or at least that was what i hoped. when he finally went to the doctor he got a lecture about his drinking. his drinking caused the drippy dick. along with what ever issue was actually causing the problem. the rash needed calamine. and was indeed probably my fault. so that's the story about how i found out i wasn't allergic to poison oak and ivy, and that you still can't touch your vagina or mouth with oil on your hands. and how i thought i gave two men an std with out actually being promiscuous.",had poison oak on my vagina and spread it to my fuck buddy and my ex. ex thought i gave him an std because of his drinking problem and my rash.,i gave my son an std because i thought he was allergic to poison oak. he had the smallest amount of poison oak rash on his dick. he had an std.,0.4838709677419355,0.13333333333333333,0.22580645161290322

test-3797,"throwaway because my siblings know who i am and idk this is something i don't want associated with my reddit account. maybe because it's a personal story. obligatory this happened a few weeks ago, but it's been on my mind for a while so i want to vent my fuck up. backstory: so my dad and i are not on very good terms, ever. there's a lot of fighting between us  growing up like most typical asian parents/families. that doesn't mean we hate each other. we love each other, but we struggle expressing it. it's hard for us to do anything together without it ending in screaming or yelling. we're just such different people, and we just lost all ways to connect to each other. it sucks, because i want to be a good son, but there's just no way for us to really relate to each other anymore. me going away to college was kinda a good thing, it gave us less time to hate each other because we have less time to see each other. cue pokemon go, released last summer. when it came out, i got the app and so did the rest of my family. we actually played it together, which was interesting because that *never* happened before. of course, my parents still had work, i was on summer break doing an internship, and my siblings were also working but still playing the game. we'd talk about it all the time, like ""omg look what i caught!"" and stuff like that. it was an exciting experience. sometimes we'd go on family drives to the nearby pokestop/gym . it was definitely an interesting experience because it never ended in yelling. when college resumed , my dad helped me move in to my new apartment. the first thing we noticed was that there were 2 pokestops within reach of my bedroom. he joked about how unfair that was because we only had 2 pokestops in my town, and here back at college there are like a thousand pokestops and gyms nearby. anyways, after moving in, he went on his way, and that ended the summer. every time he came to visit me in college  whether it was to pick me up for something, drop off something, or whatever  he'd always go back on pokemon go and swipe for all the stops. even when everyone stopped playing, my family would still play and talk about it well throughout the school year. then one day, in like february, my friend was showing me her collection of pokemon . she had 20 charizards, 20 gyarados, 5 dragonites and tyranitars and everything.and i was like ""wait a minute. we used to only have like 3 strong pokemon each, wtf happened?!"" and she showed me that she started spoofing the game. she set it up on my phone in less than 20 seconds and suddenly i was in california, catching wild charmanders.  instantly i was hooked to spoofing. i didn't use it to conquer gyms or catch op strong pokemon. in fact, i still only have 3 strong pokemon, and they're currently occupying random gyms in idk where asia and they've been there for months . i used it to travel the world tbh, visiting places around the world  eventually, i spoofed myself to boredom and quit the game.  it just defeats all the purpose of the game, and it's no longer interesting to me anymore. on the last day of college, when my dad came to help me pack up and leave, he started up the pokemon go app again. he said, ""bet you're gonna miss these pokestops, huh?"" and i casually replied, ""nah, nobody plays anymore. everybody just hacks nowadays, the game is dead."" he responded, ""oh."" and that was that. i'll never forget that look on his face. he looked sad, kinda like a defeated sad. as if this was his favorite game, and i just told him it sucks. woops. i'm fucking crying right now while typing this. it feels like the last thing that kept us together was gone. and i feel like such a shitty son for what i did. i didn't even know how important this was to him until i just dropped the bomb like that. i killed the game for myself, and i kinda just killed the game for my dad too. it's so obvious he was only playing to keep in touch with his kids. this was the first effort he made to actually connect with us again in a long time, since we're all adults now. and i fucking slaughtered it. i'm such a shitty son. even at graduation, which happened like a few days ago, *i still yelled at my parents.* i can't help it and i don't know how to fix it. i wish it was easier, but holy shit is this hard.","started spoofing pokemon go, which killed the game for me. didn't realize pokemon go was the last sliver of connection between me and my dad.**","played pokemon go with my family for the first time, dad now visits me in college and swipes for all the pokestops every time he comes.",0.34615384615384615,0.04,0.23076923076923078

test-3625,"this did not happen today, but a few weeks ago. the night of april 15, in fact.  so, it's the second week of spring quarter at my college, and i'm on my way to a party with some friends. the event is formal attire, so i'm wearing my favorite suit, along with my favorite tailored shirt . my friend, let's call him carl, and i realized we hadn't eaten all day, which is never a wise thing when you're expecting to get drunk, so we decide to be late and stop by a burger place to grab something to eat with our dates. well, since everyone else had pregamed, by the time we arrived , everyone is pretty buzzed and having a good time. not knowing too many people at the time, i felt i needed to get on their level and quick, so i could be enjoying myself as they all were. so, i drunk a lot. i took shots with everyone who asked, i hit a wine bag, i took more shots, not watching myself at all. the last thing i really remember is handing my suit jacket to a friend  who put it away for me. well, i woke up in the morning at the hospital connected to the iv. a nurse noticed i had woken up, handed me my phone , and asked for my insurance info . realizing what had happened, i called my date who came to pick me up, along with my roommate who was also at the party. when they arrived, a nurse named gretchen informed me of my situation. apparently i got way too drunk and went unconscious while simultaneously throwing up, so my friends called an ambulance for me which brought me there. anyway, after scolding me for being stupid, gretchen told me what to expect during the day, to take it easy, i'll be sick, etc. my friend drives me home, and i basically spend the entire day incapacitated. i sleep for several hours, and wake up super thirsty. i drink some water by my bed, but apparently way too fast. i began throwing up all over my bed. comforter, sheets, mattress, some splattered on my shoes, everywhere. feeling like a mess, i decide to take a shower. i feel like shit. in the shower, i know i still need to throw up. i can just feel it. so i force it, but i guess since all the fluids and food are already out of me, nothing like that comes up. instead, this burning hot  fluid comes up, and then i swallow it, sort of like a baby barf. idk what it was, but after that, whenever i tried to eat during the day, it tasted absolutely disgusting and burned where the hot fluid touched. i tried simple stuff like apple sauce and yogurt, and both tasted/felt horrible. it lasted until morning .   anyway, throughout the day, i see friends who were at the party, and learn some of what i did. it's the first time i've genuinely blacked out, so i legitimately don't remember any of this. apparently, i jumped in a pool , not once, but twice. the first was by myself, then i got out and three of my friends decided they wanted to jump in with me. at some point, it was clear i couldn't hold myself up, and some friends walked me home . that's when they place me in the bathtub and saw i was in a pretty bad condition and called the ambulance. happened within an hour and thirty minutes of my arrival at the party.  fast forward a few days later, i get home and realize i need to wash my clothes from sunday night, so i grab the bag of personal belongings  the hospital sent home with me. well, remember how i jumped in the pool? well, in the damp, moist, dark bag, guess what grew all over my favorite slacks? yup. mold. bright white spots covered in a hairy substance covered the pant legs. i've washed it since then, and the mold is gone, but it made some faded white stains on the slacks .  however, i realize while *most* of my clothes were in the bag , i'm missing my shirt. i ask my roommate who went in the ambulance with me. ""oh. they cut it."" apparently, since they needed to get the iv in my unconscious self, they cut up the sleeves then ripped the shirt off me. my favorite shirt, the only one tailored to myself, just cut up and casted aside. *sigh* i got the bill sometime that week. *$3200.* the ambulance was $2000 alone. now, my family doesn't know i drink, and i can't think of a way to explain this, so i can't use our insurance. i can't. the school insurance i used only covered $200, so i'm responsible for paying $3000 in payment over the next few years.  on the bright side, apparently i didn't do anything to embarrass myself reputation wise at the party.","got too drunk and went to the hospital. the hospital bill costs me $3000 out of pocket, they cut up my favorite shirt to insert an iv, and i threw up some fluid that burned my mouth. oh, and my wet pants got moldy.","went to a party, got way too drunk, threw up all over my bed, woke up in the morning at the hospital connected to the iv.",0.39999999999999997,0.14705882352941177,0.2285714285714286

test-3904,"so, today was the last day before classes resumed. i wanted to enjoy it and actually take the time to savor food before i had to go back to stuffing the nearest pastry down my throat before leaving. so, i decided to make some nice ""sunny side up"" eggs to make my day just the bit better, as well as try the slow cooking, single egg cooker that i received for christmas. the device was fairly simple. plug the cooker in, wait for it to heat up, put the egg on, close the lid, and wait for it to ding to take the egg out. i thought to myself, ""seems easy enough."" so, i grabbed the toaster, which only made one piece of toast at a time, the two eggs, and the two pieces of bread, and placed the butter on the fridge door, all while the egg cooker took its time to heat up.  once i heard the ding that let me know i could put the egg in, i grabbed the first egg and put it in. this one came out beautifully. just by looking at it, i could tell that it was going to be runny and really delicious. i moved it to the plate, put the first piece of toast into the toaster, and went to put the second egg in. now, i hadn't originally timed how long it took to cook the first egg, so i wasn't able to time anything properly. however, i followed the motions of putting the egg in and left it to cook. the first thing to be done was the toast, so i went over and put it down again. because i like my toast a little darker, i put it down one extra time while the egg was still cooking, and so i lost track of the egg. the toast reappeared and i switched it out for the second and began to butter. my first mistake began here when i thought it would be a good idea to crank up the intensity of the toaster to speed up the toast making process.  my second mistake was thinking the second piece of toast needed to be put back down again.  once the egg was ready, i went over to take it out and put it onto the plate. at that same time, i smelled the toast burning. in the heat of the moment, i rushed over to cancel the toasting, but i ended up knocking over the egg cooker. i panicked and decided to save the stove from the impending mess that was the runny egg instead of stopping the toast from burning. i reached to pick up the cooker but then realized a second later what i had done: i grabbed the top part of the cooker that was on and hot with half of my hand. when the pain finally set in, i immediately shot to the sink to rinse it under cold water, completely forgetting about my piece of toast, which was now burned to a crisp and creating smoke. thankfully, it didn't set off the smoke detector, and i was able to get it out and into the trash. in the end, i had second degree burns on half of my right hand, and a burned piece of toast, but the eggs were good at least. that egg cooker can make some really good eggs if you don't mess it up.","i got an egg cooker for christmas and wanted to use it to make eggs for my last day before my classes resumed, but i failed miserably and ended up with second degree burns on part of my right hand as well as a burned piece of toast, and some delicious eggs.","tried to make eggs with an egg cooker, ended up knocking over the cooker and almost burning the house down because i thought it was a good idea to speed up the toast making process.",0.36781609195402304,0.11764705882352941,0.18390804597701152

test-4207,"this happened a few weeks ago but i kept forgetting to post the tale on a weekend when bodily fluids are allowed!  during my morning pee i was feeling pretty congested and grabbed some tissue to multi task. initially i felt a bit of pressure and an uncomfortable sensation from my lady bits, uncomfortable might be a downplay as it felt like i was passing a chestnut . alarmingly i noticed a little blood on the tissue when i wiped, but thankfully google let me in on how common this is . so i new i wasn't er worthy broken but due to the stories on some of the forums i new i was in for some unfun with future pee stops. i was unprepared. each time i've peed it's felt like lemon juice pouring over a hundred paper cuts in my urethra. so much pain. i drank a bunch of cranberry juice  and needed to pee every 4 hours, it was excruciating and eventually out of fear i stopped drinking all fluids to avoid needing to pee. the next day i managed to go 8 hours without peeing and noticed a huge improvement in the pain level so i went with the dehydration method to let my inside heal a bit. google also tells me that i may have impacted my pelvic floor and it can lead to issues with incontinence . i also learnt that there are specialized physiotherapists to help undo the damage! so yeah, ladies of the world please spread the word, don't blow your nose while you pee!   edit: grammar","blew my nose while peeing, tore something in my urethra and learned that women shouldn't blow their nose while peeing.","blew my nose while peeing, cut my urethra, had to pee every 4 hours for 8 hours, may have impacted my pelvic floor and lead to issues with incontinence.",0.36000000000000004,0.20833333333333331,0.32
