test-0,"let me start by giving some backstory: my mom and her friend both went from high school to being sales reps for rollerblade. fast forward a year or two. during those years, they traveled the world together just selling rollerblades (by then the were both professional skaters.) my mom met my dad who was also working for the company. she branched away from just selling skates, and decided to produce a live show. this show (ill say the name later in the story) had rollerblades, bmx bikes, skateboarders, ect. keep in mind my dad and my mom were just dating then, she was living with her friend. one of  the skateboarders in my moms show caught her friend’s (named erin) eye. they later started dating, then got married, and had two kids. (lets call them carl and rick.) they are both boys, but erin always wanted a girl. fast forward a few years, my mom and dad got married, my mom gave birth to my sister and i, and we are very close with their family. by now the skateboarder is pretty famous, and a few years earlier him and erin got divorced. fast forward about ten years and carl and i skyped every day, and we still do, and our families always go on vacation together because we are so close. during those 10 years i skipped over, erin met a new boyfriend. (lets call him glenn, and yes i am getting these names from the walking dead.) since she always wanted a girl, glenn and her decided to adopt a girl from india. because of the shitty adoption services in india, and the fact that she had two boys already, they wouldn't let her adopt the girl. eventually after lots of struggle she finally was able to find a loophole and adopted the girl. by now carl is 14 and rick is 16. tbh i dont really know why but during the whole process she also adopted an 8 year old deaf boy named (lets call him frank). so like i said before our familys always go on vacation together. now the tifu starts:<n>it was winter break, and our families were in utah along with my mom’s other friend who happens to be a good cook. she insisted to cook us dinner so we were all sitting around, the two adopted kids were both watching tv and some of us were at the table playing uno or ust talking. so my mom’s friend put a bowl of soup on the table and rick’s mom wanted him to try tit but since he is a pretty picky eater, he didnt want to try it. (by the way both of our moms are big animal lovers.) so while his mom was trying to convince him to try the soup by telling him stories about how this girl went to china and was forced to eat a dog and just that kind of weird food stuff. at the same time my mom was talking to her about how its ok  if he doesn't feel like trying it. ( and the person who made the soup didnt care if he ate it or not.) oh and my mom was getting involved because she said i didnt have to if i didnt want to while his mom thought the opposite. eventually we both just went upstairs and were playing super smash bros the eventually went to sleep. the next morning we came downstairs and saw them arguing about something else and then they just left. our familys are both still very close but our moms wont talk to each other. all over a bowl of soup.<n>i might talk about her leaving in more detail in the comments if anyone wants it but this story is already super long.",my mom and my friends mom arguing over us eating soup ended up with them not talking to eachother and therefore ending a lifelong relationship.,i made my tacos with glass in them. it fell off and i ate it. i'm a dumbass. i'm an idiot.,0.20833333333333331,0.0,0.20833333333333331

test-0,"so a little bit of background. my wife and i are animal lovers. we live in a small 3br house with 4 dogs in northern mississippi. we also work with a few different rescues and in the past year we've fostered 10 dogs and found homes for each of them. along with this we do transports in which we take the dogs to a designated area where someone else in the rescue picks them up to take them to the next destination until finally reaching there ""furever"" home. we don't do this for recognition we do this because we simply love animals. with all that being said there are times when we don't have the room to foster or have others available to foster. in this case we take them to our local shelter which is a no-kill shelter. <n>so main story. my wife sees a dog as we're on our way to the interstate and sees a stray dog with a collar, but no tag, behind a gas station. naturally we pick it up without question. we know that we don't have any room for another foster, and we know that our network is out of room also. so we decided the best decision is to take him to the no kill shelter rather than leave him wondering around near the streets. wrong. we proceed to take this dog, literally right down the street to the shelter. the lady is scowling as usual, but i smile past it as she ask for my license. she steps away as i'm telling another worker how i came across this dog. she comes back huffing and says, "" my director said we'll take this one but this is the last one because yall are bringing us way to many."" in the past year we've personally taken a total of 4 animals. 2 kittens and 2 dogs. the last dog we took them was 1-2 months ago and they told us because we had the dog over night (this was a sunday and we thought they were closed) that we had to pay $40 because we kept it overnight. i kept calm and i said we bring these animals when we have no other options because are homes are full from fostering. she replies with, ""it doesn't matter this is the last one."" i say ok and leave.<n>i then call the shelter to get in touch with the director hoping that it's just a miscommunication. surely this facility would not rather me leave these animals on the road. wrong. i call and get on the phone and proceed to tell him that we're fosters and that we bring these dogs to them as last resort. he responds by saying that he talked to one of the rescue facilities and the lady there has never heard of me and that he found our actions suspicious because we've brought them 8 dogs recently........2 cats+2 dogs= 8 dogs. at this point all bets are off and i ask him to show me the 8 dogs i brought and the dates i brought them. he then says, ""i can do it it'll probably just take a while."" followed by ""we never said you can't bring any more up here we said....you know what...you're right you call us and we'll come to you to get the animals because you dont work for us!"" that's right. my tax dollars pay for your doors to swing. so i'm officially banned from bringing strays to our no kill shelter. thank you southaven, ms.","tried to take stray dog to the no kill shelter. was accused of wanting forever-puppies and turning in 8 dogs in the past couple of months. in reality it was 2 dogs and 2 kittens over the past year. banned from taking any animals to the southaven, ms no kill shelter.","gave a patient a bladder installation that has a live tuberculosis bacteria in it to fight bladder cancer. added bleach and ammonia to pee to kill the bacteria. urine reacted violently and there was a foul smelling blast of pee, bleach, and tuberculosis followed by an extensive cleaning in a stank smelling room.",0.22857142857142856,0.0,0.13333333333333333

nope, your dead wrong, huge fuckin biggie. when she comes back home she flips her shit. mind you around the time i graduated highschool she had (i assume) started to go through menapause hard, she was already a rash aggressive person, or as i refer to it, absolutley crazy. but after i graduated she steppped the crazyness up to a whole new ungodly level, but she would have periods where she was alright, even cool most of the time. but every now and again she would just get abusive and mean, constantly comparing me to my father who was a ""woman beating, pot smoking peice of shit"" (i later find out that the only time my father ever hit my mom was because she set him on fire).<n> so she loses her mind, and she starts threatening to call the police and kick me out of the house for disconnecting her sonos, eventually she calms down because i reconncect the sonos. which btw, is not a hard process to complete. so i think crisis averted. i wasnt worried about her kicking me out because she had threatened to kick me out on a weekly basis even when i was still in school.<n>flash forward to a week later, she leaves town again, and i disconnect the sonos to play video games. when she comes back into town im at work and suddenly receive an onslaught of text messages, basically saying that im a ""worthless human being that she hates cause im just like my father. and that all my shit will be on the porch when i get home""  so i tell my buddy, ""hey i may need a ride home, my mom is kinda going crazy right now and i doupt its anything serious, but i may not have a place to sleep tonight""  when i do finally get off work i find that this time she was not fucking around. everything i own is on the front porch in garbage bags, with the exception of a tin containg 3000$ that i was saving to move to chicago (chicago is a big comedy city). <n>      at this point i ask my friend if i can stay with him and his family for the night. <n>the next morning we head back to my moms house to gather my things, and by this point i am absolutley done with the person. i refuse to refer to her as my mom and when i get there to gather my things i notice that my tin is missing. this sets me over the edge, i am absolutley furious at this point. so i knock on the door to ask about it, she cracks the door and asks me what i want and without even replying i force the door open, and walk back to my room, she keeps trying to get in front of me and stop me, but im a 6'5 former highschool wrestler so its not too much of a challenge to push her out of the way. i tear my room apart looking for this tin, i know for a fact that she must have taken the money. so i tell her im not leaving until i have either that tin, or the equivalent of what was in it. she then threatens to call the police when i remind her that if she does shes responsible for 3000$ worth of lost money because it was in her possesion at some point. so she writes me a check for 300$ dollars and basically tells me to fuck off. i figure this is all im getting and i have 600 in my bank account so i just take my things and leave.<n>but wait theres more! i remembered that one of my friends from comedy was looking for a roommate downtown! wonderful coincidence right?! but it turns out the guy whos subbletting me the room really doesnt trust me, being a 19 year old and all. he is very reluctant to allow me to stay there. but eventually he does! w00t score! i have a place to live, and money for the first month while i look for a job. then i realize that food is expensive, especially when you're an irresponsible 19 year old who loves fast food. i dont have enough money to pay what i owe for the rest of the month and the next month. so its time to give in and call my dad, i hate more than anything asking for handouts, but it had to be done. i call him and we finally have the talk about how crazy my mom actually is (he tells me the story of her setting him on fire) but he told me the reason he never told me any of this is because he didnt want to taint my opinion of her cause shes still my mom, but he always knew that eventually i would find out. so he agrees to help me get on my feet, and after a month of hitting the pavement every single day i find a job! im so excited! my room mate too, he even buys me a bottle of whiskey to celebrate! what an awesome guy! well, ole 19 year old me cant really handle his booze and i decide that things are going to well so i have to fuck myself over once again! go me! i decide after my room mate goes to bed what im gonna do, in the lamest attempt at a prank ever, is go steal a lamp from the 3rd floor common area and replace with his expensive modern art lamp, just to see how long before he notices! oh we comedians surely are a wiley bunch! but, as im coming down the elevator lamp in hand the buildings security guard is making his rounds, fuck me right!?

(she still has basically a full glass) and she says no, so i walk over to the keg, get another beer, and start chatting with random people i don't know, as i'm starved for a conversation. i finish talking to some people, they give me another beer, and a shot, and i walk back to my date. she's still on her phone, and then she [without talking mind you] holds up her phone to my face. it's a text message, and it says ""so and so is arrested, come help."" she then says ""i'm leaving, you probably shouldn't come.""<n>so here i am. alone at a party. 30 minutes from my apartment, and all my friends. stuck at a party with random people, and my date just left. she then texts me and says, ""i don't know what to tell you, but i'm also going to sleep at a friend's place."" so now not only am i stuck at this party, but i now have nowhere to even sleep for the night. and to make matters worse the party ran out of beer, and the host starts pushing people out. what do i do? i had a couple of beers, i shouldn't drive home, but i'm completely lost. so now i'm aimlessly walking around this random campus, trying to walk off my slight buzz. i walk around for like 30 minutes, chug some water at a convenience store, and drive home.<n>i am very... very annoyed, and so i proceed to get really drunk with my friends back home. now that i'm drunk i think it would be a good idea to send an angry text, to vent some frustration. so i tell her that i had an awful time, and she should really be ashamed of how i was treated. (i realize her friend got arrested, but it's not like i can't at least come and help out. you don't just ditch a guy and hang him to dry. i realize i might not be as important as your friend, but that doesn't mean you should leave your date stranded in an area he's never been to). and so her friend texts back and says ""you really fucked up man, this girl's a real catch (a 'dime' as he put it), and i've known her since elementary school, and you ruined something really good for you."" now i'm no expert on women. but i think she's the exact opposite of a catch. so i realize this, decide not to get into some childish texting argument, say i'm sorry, apologize for the unwarranted text, and i'm not talking to her again.<n>so yeah... i'm going to stay off tindr for a while.","went on a tindr date, 30 minutes away from me, she left me stranded in a place i'm unfamiliar with, and i basically had a bad night.",i locked myself out of my house and had to pay 300 dollars to a locksmith who had to drill a hole in the door in order to get me inside.,0.23728813559322032,0.0,0.13559322033898305

test-0,"as always, my fu really occurred on an earlier date - in this case, december 2010 - but this is more of a series of fu's that ends in diarrhea , so hang in there with me.<n>i remember it like it was yesterday.. it was the middle of december, and i was enjoying south carolina's fairly warm winter temperatures. i'm a michigan native, and 60-70 degree weather is rather unfathomable around christmas time in my home state, so this was a welcome relief during my, uh... 'get away' from the mitten. see, in the beginning, two friends and i had planned out this epic adventure that wasn't supposed to last more than ten days: we were aiming to visit each waterfall in south carolina and take some awesome landscape photography and come back up a week before christmas, and in order to accomplish this, we pitched all our extra money together to purchase a camper. so here's how that goes: friend #3 - let's call him mike - originally lived in michigan, but moved to south carolina. mike was getting a few days off work and wanted to do something epic, and friend #2  - let's name him sean - hadn't seen mike in a while and knew he wanted to visit mike and wanted to travel with me to shoot photography as well. i didn't know mike too well, but we were all really into photography at the time, and sean had recently found this awesome deal on a camper, so whatever, let's do it. mike was in: he drove his mom's miata up to michigan (she was visiting family for the holidays and agreed to drive it back down while we stayed at her apartment complex for a week or two), bought the camper with us, and we all drove back down to south carolina. <n>this was tifu #1. we paid $900 for a 1978 winnebago. there was a hole in the floor underneath the sink, the bathroom was a disaster, the doors didn't lock, and, by the time we had made it through ohio, we had lost both heat and electricity in the back half of the camper. the passenger side windshield wiper broke off while driving in kentucky. by the time had we reached west virginia, the speedometer gave out. when we found ourselves caught in a whiteout driving through the mountains, i could've sworn we were going too fast until a semi-truck passed us going uphill around a curve. i also tried pissing out the window and it all sprayed back on my chest (tifu #2). we were not smart men. so by the time we had reached our destination in south carolina, the winnebago decides enough is enough and suicides, and none of us had the money to fix it. sure, mike was back home and had his own transportation, but sean and i had no way of getting back up to michigan, and although mike and his weird little brother - we'll call him anthony because that's a serial killer's name right there - both had jobs, they lived paycheck to paycheck and could not afford to pay for us to get a bus ticket back up home. besides, sean and i had decided we'd want to wait at least a week to hang out and figure things out, so even if they could pay for us to leave, we wanted to at least hang out for a bit.<n>one week later, and we had completely partied mike's mom's apartment into oblivion. like, holes in the ceiling from throwing beer pong tables in drunken blacked out rages, stairs covered in pillows and couch cushions (we did a lot of indoor drunk sledding), memories clouded by way too much inebriation by multiple substances from numerous parties inside and outside of the apartment, dry heaving on balcony in the rain, riding bikes through the house that type of oblivion. it was a nice apartment, too. more of a townhouse, really. she was well-off for a single parent of two twenty somethings, but she didn't leave any money behind for us that week. we had spent nearly all of our money on booze. the pantry's were empty, the beer was gone, and poor mike had had too activity for one introverted personality to handle - he locked himself in his room while sean and i continued to thrive off of grilled cheese sandwiches and coca-cola. things toned down a bit by the second week. i called my dad and told him i needed money wired to me so i could get back home, but when i got the $100 he sent me, i realized i was really enjoying being stranded. with all this time on my hands, i began to adopt a real philosophical approach to things as i reflected on life. i had found a library nearby and spent a lot of time reading walden by thoreau, going on walks to the ocean, and walking to walmart to pick up 6 packs of coca-cola after picking up a cigar from a local place called 'peaceful henrys'. sean would often join me on these walks around town, scouting out what the local community had to offer us (not much, everything closed after 8, unlike our 24/7 privileges back in metro detroit.) <n>this was tifu #3, because one fateful late afternoon, we found this wonderful looking brunch café at the end of this quaint little street littered with local art galleries. this place was.. well, we didn't fit in. they served breakfast and lunch, with wine and dinner entrees during special events. it was a... cordon bleu, silver platter of triangle sandwich wedges, with slices aged marbled cheese on the side type of place. sean and i were just looking for a place to get out of the sun, sit down and talk, to be honest, because we finally began to form an idea for a new series of photographs we would create now that waterfalls were more or less out of the option. this was probably the wrong place to do that, especially since we had decided that between the two of us - two shabby detroit bred punks wearing our bare feet - we wanted to pay the absolute minimum necessary to sit down and enjoy ourselves. we went down the menu, and sean decided he would try their 'lavender hot chocolate' because ""cheapest drink that still sounded alright was $4"". sounded delicious to me, so i order the same, and nothing else. upon the realization that the two of us were going to take up room and air without ordering any food and, based upon our rough-around-the-edges look and demeanor, we probably would not end up being the best tippers, the lady donning a delicate floral gown and silver hair, who had been chosen to serve us fine gentlemen, probably didn't take too kindly to sean and i. we didn't think anything of it. anyway, the hot chocolate they served us was no chocolate flavored powder packet dumped in microwaved cup of water type of deal - this was the real deal. it was some gourmet delicacy. the drinks came out in large lavender colored bowl-shaped cups on top of small, ornate plates. the hot chocolate was a delicious lather that felt like silk going down your throat. how they made it seem to have a 'hint' of lavender is beyond me. it was perfect, and after a chat, we were gone.<n>we were making the rounds of a local art gallery 15 minutes later, critiquing the work of some artists and raving over the work of others (we probably sounded like asses), when i what i couldn't explain as anything other than a cold, wet drop of weight into my colon. i began sweating, and told sean that i think i had to go. the inside of me began expanding, and as i started walking out the door, i look back, and sean - who is about as tall as abraham lincoln when he wore a top hat - is waddling stiffly in my direction. his face was paler than a ghost. we both realized what had happened - grandma must have poisoned us by pouring laxatives in our lavender lattes. we are two miles from home with no transportation, and i can already feel the pressure of the lavender lava brimming at the edges of my rectum, waiting to burst out and fill my pants with liquid feces. sean, with his long legs and agility due to him by his skateboarding habits, is swiftly pacing down the road ahead of me, one rapid, straight legged waddle at a time. this was clearly an every man for himself sort of situation, and i was going to have to fight my way to survival. my ass cheeks were so tightly clenched that i could've formed a diamond from any crap that managed to squeak its way in between them. this method, however, was causing me to move very slowly, and if i wanted to gain speed, i would have to be a little less rigid, risking a possible breach in my anal dam. i was scanning the horizon for a patch of trees or an empty lot where i could rip my clothes off and unleash this furious chocolate monsoon, but to no avail. it was the longest 15 minutes of my life, and when i finally got back to mike's place, i almost lost it from within. i immediately headed toward the closest bathroom.. occupied by sean, who was devastating the living room toilet with a tornado of anal stew. my only other option? the bathroom upstairs, beyond the slopes of white sheets and couch cushions. in a cold sweat and red flushed cheeks on either end of my body, i bolted up the stairs, climbing the ascent swiftly through the use of my hands and knees unless i finally made it to the top. when i reached the last step, i glanced over and saw that the bathroom was wide open and available for me to relieve myself of this hellish nightmare. i was in the clearing, and i had already began to loosen my rectum and unbutton my pants as i sprinted toward the porcelain throne, when, to my very demise, my back foot get snared within an elastic bed sheet wrapped around a mattress on the top of the pillow slope and tied to the railing. i trip forward, slam my forehead on the corner of the wall, and stumble backward onto the mattress. as i tumble backward onto the mattress, i shart into and out of my pants that, by now, had only been covering a half of my behind. i bounce off the mattress in some sort of backward somersault/flip and began releasing liquid mayhem on the sheets and pillows below me and the ceiling immediately above the stairwell. the whole sequence probably [looked a lot like this](https://youtu.be/1gs3emn4cic?t=72). there was liquid crap everywhere -

test-0,"this happened earlier today. i was thinking about recording some footage from my play station 2, and i remembered that one of my parent's old media center computers had a tv receiver pci card with composite video. this would let me record my ps2 on my desktop, or perhaps even live stream it. i was curious if it would work in my current desktop. i knew it was quite old, and the computer it was in had been sitting in a shed for multiple years. i thought it was still worth a shot, so i got to digging and eventually found it. i found the computer, and the card in it was caked in dust. at the time i thought a simple fix would be to blow it off with an air compressor (canned air is really expensive). the air compressor cleaned it off a fair amount, not perfect, but good enough. i plopped it into my main desktop (around 700$ because of used bargain hunting), and it appeared to work fine. after about 20 minutes of screwing around with the video capture, my computer suddenly shut off and rebooted. it turned back on with no video, and i started to smell burnt plastic. in the panic, i reached back and unplugged it. i pulled the card out, and while it wasn't hot and appeared fine, it clearly wasn't safe to use. i had stuff to go to, so i plugged my computer back in without the card and left. when i came back, i decided to check on my computer. i turned it on, and no video signal. after about an hour of troubleshooting with the hardware in it i gave up and finally gave into the suspicion that something was dead. an hour of testing other hardware later, i came to the conclusion that at the very least my motherboard didn't function (around 200$ for a new one with the same features), and now i'm not sure if my graphics card works (a 980ti that costs around 400$ nowadays).<n>i don't have a job yet, and so i'm basically stuck without any projects or games from my desktop until i get one, or do things for friends and family (how i got money for parts in the first place).<n>still don't know why i thought it would be a good idea to stuff a card that i had no idea whether or not worked into the most expensive computer in my house.<n> <n>edit: basically reseated everything, tried different ram, hdds, and gpus, even without any components, still nothing unfortunately.",i killed my computer with an old capture card. no pc for quite a while.,tried to have a quickie with my wife and ended up burning my cock and her ass with a hair straightener. we laughed about it for the rest of the day.,0.17391304347826086,0.0,0.13043478260869568

test-0,"so this tifu actually happened about five years ago on my 21st birthday, but i was thinking about it today and decided to share with reddit, because i think reddit would enjoy. <n>so i was going to college and living in a house with 7 other dudes - it was just a big ol' party house. it's saturday, and my birthday is technically on sunday, so we're going to go out to celebrate me being 21 at midnight. at 5 pm, my roomate's bust into my room with a 6 pack of every type of woodchuck cider they can find (i was a real man's man then - loved me some woodchuck). so naturally, we start drinking at 5. this is where i should stop and say that i've always been a lightweight, which is great for my wallet just not ideal for my pride.<n>so, after heavily drinking for 7 hours, by the time midnight rolls around i'm already kind of drunk (ok... drunk). we go to the first bar, have a few shots (my first shot as a legal drinker was wild turkey, which a horrible friend tricked me into believing would taste delicious). as we're headed to the second bar, i'm so drunk that i'm skipping across the crosswalk and yelling at cops stopped at the light that, ""i'm 21, i'm untouchable bitches, yeahhhh!"" in retrospect, that was sign 1 that maybe i should have ended my night there.<n>but off we went to the second bar, which was really the only bar that i actually wanted to go to. we made it inside, my friends bought a fish bowl, plus the additional shot of 151 you can add into it. it being my birthday, of course i have to drink the 151 shot separately and do so. in the shot goes and immediately it comes right back out onto the bar and i kicked it not even a minute after walking into the only bar i wanted to go to. in retrospect, that is probably sign 2 that i should've ended my night.<n>but we did not end the night. instead we went to a third bar and did more drinks and shots. i get to the point where i'm trying to dance (side note - i embody every stereotype of white people when it comes to dancing) but i'm so drunk that i keep falling over and crashing against people/tables, etc. probably the only reason i didn't get kicked out was that the bar was too crowded and we were far away from where the bouncers or staff could easily see us. so we close down bar three, with me being the drunkest i have ever been in my life (to this day). <n>i do not have the ability to walk on my own and two of my friends are helping me move. as we're exiting the bar, my drunken attempts to walk result in me accidentally kicking a behemoth of a gentleman who has also been drinking. this, of course, pisses off said behemoth who is ready to kick my scrawny drunk ass into oblivion. luckily, my friends talked him down and got me the hell out of there (saving me a likely trip to the hospital.)<n>so finally, my friends manage to drag me from the bar to the home (i was essentially dead weight at this point). we get back home, and i tell them i'm too drunk to walk to the bathroom and need them to take me. they do, i puke as people celebrating their 21st are wont to do. after puking my guts out, my friends drag me up into my bedroom, toss me into bed and go to bed themselves. all in all, a pretty good 21st birthday at this point. unfortunately, the night didn't end there.<n>here's where my tifu comes in. somehow, in the middle of the night, i got up out of my bed to go to the bathroom. i live on the second floor, and there's a bathroom at the end of my hall. now keep in mind, that i was too drunk to walk for the majority of the night. instead of shambling to the end of the hallway into the bathroom that is right there, black-out me somehow stumbles up the stairs to the third story and into my roomate's bedroom. i'm not sure how this happened, because i was completely blacked out at this point.<n>so, according to my roomate (who sleeps in the nude), lets call him grimes, he hears the door to his room open and hears someone stumble into his bedroom. he doesn't have his glasses on, but he can vaguely figure out that it's me.<n>""agentchuckbartowski? wtf are you doing?""<n>""sorry grimes..."" i mumble. ""i'm a ninja."" next thing, he hears the sound of water hitting the floor.<n>""agentchuckbartowski, what the fuck!""<n>""sorry grimes... ninja..."" i continued to drunkenly mumble ninja as i relieved myself. once i was done, without another word, i stumble out of his bedroom, down the stairs and back into my bed, and poor grimes just sat there in shock unsure of what the fuck just happened and what to do.<n>the next morning<n>hungover as all hell, i come downstairs where my roomates are sitting on a couch laughing at grimes. grimes looks really pissed off.<n>""agentchuckbartowski, we need to fucking talk."" grimes says.<n>""whatever grimes."" i casually dismiss.

test-0,"so my wife has cancer which is likely treatable but nothing is guaranteed in life and it appears to be far along.  i've tried to be supportive for our daughters sake but our marriage wasn't great to begin with.  so the other day my wife mentioned that she wanted to look into medical marijuana as treatment.  this didn't really phase me as i've read accounts of it helping with recovery and coping with all the fun side effects of cancer treatments and told her she should definitely look into it.  so i did not however realize that she meant as the primary and only form of treatment.  i managed not to start screaming at her when i realized this as usually when i try to hell her about the magic of this thing called the scientific method over anecdotal evidence from people who believe that big pharma is keeping ""cures"" away from them because they can't make money she tends to call me an asshole and double down on her distrust of modern medicine.  her friends appear to all be drinking the koolaid as well so that is awesome cause when you tell someone they are throwing their life away you want to make sure that everyone they trust will tell them that she is right magic oils will make her tumors go away and that i am retarded for believing she should go with a proven treatment promoted by crazy people that went to medical school.<n>so i've trolled the web trying to look for arguments that don't make me sound like an asshole while i explain to her that hemp oil isn't going to cure her but every site about this issue is written from a modern medicine is evil or a no one actually believe this quackery so lets make fun of it perspective.  trying to phrase it in a way that doesn't sound like quit being a retarded bitch and wake up is not as easy as it sounds so tonight i'm going to fuck up again and tell her she needs to get real treatment so she can stick around for our kids and try to remain calm and not patronize her.  at some point she is going to start with the you don't support me and my choices and don't respect my beliefs at which point i will start yelling and my daughters will get to deal with a divorce while they watch their mother die of cancer because she won't get real treatment.<n>good times",we've all got to die sometime why not sooner than later.,"didn't get lunch for a week, school thought i was anorexic, counselors thought i was depressed, lunch ladies watched me for the rest of the year.",0.0,0.0,0.0

test-0,"so, for the past month, i've been waiting for a test called the psat. it is essentially something meant to get your name out to colleges and provide scholarly opportunities or whatever the fuck. i really need those opportunities, because when it comes to educational finances, i'm on my own. and the way i see it, if i have to turn to student loans, i might as well just fuckin kill myself (i'm joking, i think. who knows, i'm super bummed out right now), because that's some crazy debt i could get myself trapped under. <n>i'm a junior in high school, and this is the only time i can take this test and have it actually matter. i took it last year as a practice test and got some pretty damn rad scores. it got my name out to colleges in the region, earning me a lot of recruit letters and other more cool things like invitations to successful scholar meetings/organizations and recognition from buzz fucking aldrin. that's great and all i guess, but i took it as a sophomore, so those scores, as far as i understand, don't amount to jack shit. that's fine still, because i was gonna take it this morning as a junior!<n>except i didn't. i consciously thought about it last night and was prepared for the test, got some good sleep, and then i completely forgot about it. i didn't remember until someone mentioned it in second block, which is when i exclaimed one word -- ""shit!!"" -- and ran to the office, horrified to discover the absence of our guidance councellors. i talked with the lady at the front desk, who emailed a counselor to tell them what was happening and asking what options i have. it was immediately responded to with ""nothing. no retakes. sorry.""<n>all i could say was a super calm ""fiddlesticks,"" but god dammit i just fucked up a serious opportunity and i only had one chance. why the fuck are there no retakes or anything for something like this?? <n> <n>edit: can confirm, i just totally dicked my life by going to school as if it were a normal day. not even exaggerating. my only hope is a perfect sat score.",i got morning amnesia and didn't go to a test that could've benefited my already blurry future.,"i was playing the drums and a drumstick bounced off the drum and hit me square in the chin, causing me to bleed profusely and have to get stitches.",0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.125

test-0,"this actually happened a few years ago, well a little more because i was around 8-10 at the time. i went for a movie, and it was one of those action gun shooting movies that you see all the time (i forgot the name of it). there was a part where they captured the main character and they tied him to a chair. then, they put a towel over his face and poured a bucket of water on him. i thought to myself “it’s so hot in that room it’s probably not even that bad”. after the movie, i went home and after a while i got bored. then i remembered the scene from that movie and decided to try it out myself. i went and got a towel, and then laid down on the counter, putting my head under the sink faucet. i put the towel over my face and turned the water on. you can only imagine what happened next. i suddenly realized what was happening in the movie. as soon as i turned the faucet on, i couldn’t breathe. this scared he living shit out of me, and i tried to scream, which made it like 10x worse. i started thinking to myself that i was gonna die. with my amazing problem solving skills i tried to remove my head from under the faucet and hit my head on it really hard. i somehow managed to get the towel off of my head and i was freaking out whilst turning the water off. i just sat on the ground and cried my ass off for like an hour. and that’s how i learned what waterboarding was. also after about an hour i had a half circle kind of bruise on the top of my forehead from hitting the faucet.<n> <n>edit: my now most upvoted post is about me being a dumbass! thanks guys! <n>/s","saw a waterboarding scene in an action movie and decided to try it myself, ended with me crying with a bruise on my forehead.",i didn’t listen to my mother when she told me not to wash my underwear and now i’m probably going to have to pay a lot of money to get my washing machine fixed.,0.16666666666666669,0.0,0.13333333333333333
